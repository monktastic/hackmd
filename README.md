### Kindness

The desire to be unkind to "bad people" is a trick our mind uses to hide our own complicity (in the world's evils) from ourselves. It just creates more evil.

* [Radical kindness](radical-kindness/radical-kindness.md)
* [Herd immunity against evil](radical-kindness/herd-immunity.md) is a civic duty.
* [You are everyone](radical-kindness/you-are-everyone.md). This is the ultimate root of kindness.

### Quantum mechanics

Despite over a century of trying to escape the inevitable consequences of quantum mechanics, the original punchline still holds: _you_ are indeed at the center of it all. Modern attempts to avoid this conclusion (such as _decoherence_ or "objective collapse") are red herrings.

### Idealism

The ground of reality is intrinsically conscious, and you are That. There is a strong rational argument for taking this possibility more seriously than the others (although the ultimate truth is actually more subtle still).

* [Life is miraculous](philosophy/life-is-miraculous.md). Literally.
