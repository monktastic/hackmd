How would you behave if you knew that everyone else was also _you_?

It's hard to make sense of this idea intellectually, but artistic works like The Egg  can trigger a primal memory of it. Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh communicates it with heartbreaking beauty in his 
 [poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem/) _Call Me By My True Names_ (which I suggest you read in its entirety):

> _I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,  
> my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.  
> And I am the arms merchant,  
> selling deadly weapons to Uganda._
>
> _I am the twelve-year-old girl,  
> refugee on a small boat,  
> who throws herself into the ocean  
> after being raped by a sea pirate.  
> And I am the pirate,  
> my heart not yet capable  
> of seeing and loving._
>
> _I am a member of the politburo,  
> with plenty of power in my hands.  
> And I am the man who has to pay  
> his “debt of blood” to my people  
> dying slowly in a forced-labor camp._

Lest you think this is just metaphor, here's Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.

Having glimpsed this, it becomes impossible to feel contempt for _anyone_. This is the realization I believe we are all headed for, whether we know it or not.
