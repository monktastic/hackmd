# See no evil

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle._ — Unknown

> _For so long as the root of wickedness is hidden, it is strong. But when it is recognized, it is dissolved. When it is revealed, it perishes. ... It is powerful because we have not recognized it._ — The Gospel of Philip

Note: I am complete and utter hypocrite. Everything in this piece applies 100% to me. I share it because there is something that wants to be expressed.

Evil's subtlest trick is to make contempt for "bad people" feel righteous. If you fully penetrate this one trick, you will discover the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was.

In this state you secretly want to cause harm—not to improve the world, but to worsen it, so that you are licensed to feel ever more contempt. This is the ego's secret mission: to bring about a kind of armageddon, in which it can prove once and for all just how _good_ it actually is. Yet you will never suspect that this is what you're actually doing.

Or more precisely, you will know perfectly well, but you will choose not to see it. And that is exactly the "secret mechanism": self-deception. It is this bizarre schism of the mind that enables all evil. When you're in this state, you do not realize it, and nobody can convince you that you are. In fact, the harder they try, the harder you resist. You can only be encouraged, through great skill, to see it for yourself.

Simply being in this state secretly invites others into it, beneath both of your conscious thresholds: your self-deception _encourages_ theirs. On the surface, you may be enemies, but underneath, your evils are allied. Your nominal allies are also invited in. Unmistakable signatures of this invitation are contempt, self-righteousness, and malice. Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, to create more of itself under the guise of good.

In this way, evil behaves like a distributed organism, signaling to itself through the vast network of human minds. It leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us would claim to individually want, yet which are the inevitable result of our cumulative self-deception.

It is that archetypal massive evil global conspiracy: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem in the world, yet which nobody can see. And we are its unwitting minions.

Truth be told, countless people have warned us of its malevolent presence in countless ways, but we somehow manage to never listen. It is impossible to overstate just how sneaky it is.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding this organism. This continual sustenance ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show. Or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are ultimately minions of our collective shadow.

Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we vengefully string up, we secretly instruct reality to fill their shoes; all that changes are the specifics of their evil. The left hand does not know what the right is doing.

The only possible solution is compassion. This doesn't mean being nice: that conflation is a trick of our darkness. Compassion is simply the opposite of self-deception. It can be fierce, or perhaps even violent, as the situation warrants. It always holds people accountable. But it is never malicious, and that is what makes all the difference.

Compassion precisely targets the parasite within people's minds, instead of the people themselves—thus avoiding the collateral damage that would amplify the problem. Everyone can sense the difference, even if only subconsciously. This weakens their capacity for self-deception. In other words, it destroys a tiny bit of evil. Indeed, it is the only thing that can.

If you've ever witnessed misbehavior, only to suddenly recognize that it was secretly rooted in some kind of suffering, then you've had a taste of this. Before such recognition, malice towards the person feels not only warranted but positively righteous. Afterward, it ceases to make any sense. You may still have to restrain or hurt them, but somehow everything changes. What you get in exchange for giving up that insanely delicious hit of self-righteousness that vengeful retribution would have provided is what you truly desire most: a better world.

Make no mistake: evil is sometimes too intense for our compassion to work. Not because it is the wrong response, but because we have not developed the capacity to _be_ truly compassionate in the face of such evil. In that case we risk simply being nice and worsening the problem. Yet this is also the most important time to be on guard for malice. Because while it's true that evil triumphs when "good people" do nothing, the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.

Now is a good time to remind you that I am a profound hypocrite. I have very little such capacity myself, and have no interest in judging anyone else for doing what they feel they must. In fact, my very own way of living—which I am deeply reluctant to give up—presently _depends_ on people behaving in the ways I have described. That's not to say that there aren't _better_ ways of living that do _not_ require it, but I digress...

Notice that the devil on your shoulder doesn't merely whisper ideas in your ear; it alters your very perception. It entices you to literally _perceive_ fundamentally morally defective people, "deserving" of contempt. This is, in every case, a misperception. Again, nobody can convince you of this, but it can be seen directly. The angel on your shoulder isn't really outside you; it represents your true nature.

The ultimate nature of your mind is pure compassion. As you rediscover your true nature, you begin to perceive others'. You discover that neither you nor others ever really meant to be self-deceptive; it was merely a defense mechanism. And it was compassion from others that provided you with the safety and courage to finally confront it in yourself and dismantle it. Their behavior may have taken the form of tough love, but it was love nonetheless. Everyone else was simply lost in delusion themselves, which is why they gleefully tried to push you further in.

Seeing this heartbreaking mess, the only thing that makes any sense whatsoever is to share that grace freely with others. In the end, you may discover that they are not, in fact, "other." Perhaps in a sense it was all you, all along.

May all beings be free of suffering and return home.

> *Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.*
>
> *But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.*

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.*

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*
