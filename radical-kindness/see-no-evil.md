# See no evil

There is a paradoxical process at work deep in the core of your mind. Because it is so deep, it is very hard to see. In fact, it contradicts everything we think we know about reality. Therefore, you may not believe what I am about to say, but please consider it carefully.

Your deepest longing is to be good to everyone and everything. In fact, this is what you _are_ at the most fundamental level. But you unconsciously fear that you may _not_ be perfectly good. This causes you to be afraid to look too carefully at your mind, for fear of what you may uncover.

This unconscious fear gets projected outward. The result is that you see darkness in _other_ people. You perceive them as fundamentally broken. You then act from this perception, and your behavior is intended to remind them of this awful "truth" about themselves.

This in turn increases their fear of their own not-goodness, which they must similarly suppress and project—most likely onto _you_. After all, only a bad person could enjoy pushing others further from their "inner light," as you have just done. They react in a way that lets you know that _they_ know that you're a hypocrite: claiming to do good in the world while actually just increasing the darkness.

Part of you can sense the truth in their accusation, which forces you to suppress and project even harder...

Hopefully you can see where this is going. All of the evil in the world is actually just reflections of reflections of reflections of ... what? Of an infinitesimal kernel of fear that spiraled infinitely out of control, to produce the astonishing variety of madness and badness you see today.

Whose kernel was it originally? Not yours, and not mine. When did it first appear? An eternity ago; a time that is also _right now_. You see, it appeared prior to the illusion of separateness between you and me, and before the illusion of time itself. In fact, it is what gives rise to those illusions in the first place. And yet, each one of us has the capacity to discover that kernel within ourselves—and then to go _beyond_ it, to rediscover our original nature as goodness.

When this happens, your perception is transformed in a miraculous way that shatters your entire reality. It would be stupid for me to try to communicate it, so I will just leave you with [this poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem).
