# On _nice_ vs _kind_

Why do we gain so much satisfaction from watching bad people get their comeuppance? We may tell ourselves that it is a noble pleasure; that we are simply enjoying the triumph of good over evil. But in that case, why isn't it similarly satisfying to witness such people have a change of heart, or otherwise be transformed into decent human beings? Something much deeper is going on here.

The aspect of your mind that wants to see bad people get hurt (physically or emotionally) doesn't actually care about doing good. In fact, it wants those bad people to get _worse_, so that it can sustain an endless supply of bad people to hurt. It is doing this simply to maintain its self-image as the _good_ one; the _righteous_ one. It is a wolf in sheep's clothing, in Eastern religions known as the _ego._

Most of us recognize the deep folly of the "war on terror." How did the US military not realize that the collateral damage caused by bombing civilian areas would just produce more enemies? But it wasn't folly: it was at some level _intentional_. How better to keep the war machine running than to justify it with the most righteous goal of all: a war on _terror_ of all things?

If you think this mess can be laid at the feet of a few politicians and military leaders, think again. Every single time one of us feels pleasure from watching bad people get hurt, we contribute a drop to the sea of madness that enables such tragedies. The cumulative effect of each one of us doing this is a society that does this in the extreme.

So it is with today's political crisis. We blithely mock our political enemies and pat ourselves on the back for the "good" it does—blind to the fact that we are merely contributing to the mass of animosity that is spiraling toward civil war. But we're not actually blind to it: part of us wants nothing more than the bloodshed that would prove once and for all that we are the "good guys."

The ego's job is to divide the world into _good people_ and _bad people_. It is then nice to the good people, and cruel to the bad, telling you that it is making the world better, while actually worsening it.

A deeper aspect of your mind—the wisdom aspect—can see this trap playing itself out, both in your own mind and others. It knows that "evil" is nothing more than attachment to ego. This means that each one of us is at least a little bit evil.
