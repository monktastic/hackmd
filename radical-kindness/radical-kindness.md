# Radical kindness (take 2)

###### tags: `kindness`

There's a perverse pleasure we humans get from watching "bad people" get their comeuppance --- be it in violent revenge flicks like _The Equalizer_, YouTube compilations of "Karens getting owned," or even just private fantasies where we imagine the evil cabal responsible for climate change getting whatever it is they deserve. I say "perverse" because it stems from a profound misunderstanding of human nature, and leads to a lot more suffering than we realize. I want to see society put this madness to rest.

The key insight is that you are ultimately no better or worse than anybody else. The word "ultimately" is important here: clearly you _are_ better or worse than others in _some_ ways---including moral ones. But not *ultimately*.

People come to this realization via a variety of routes. Life experience, meditation, and even psychedelics can do the trick. The following quote captures the "aha" moment well (emphasis mine):

> _My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.**_

> _Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc._

Having had this revelation, one's entire outlook on "good" and "bad" is profoundly transformed. This transformation is captured well in the following quote, this time by a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA:

> _My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way… a white screen with some dark spots._

One directly perceives the sense in which deep down (perhaps _very_ deep down), nobody actually _wants_ to be a jerk. They only do it because they are trapped in some horrific delusion --- whether they can admit (or even *recognize*) this or not. And what pleasure can there be in driving such a person _further_ into delusion? Celebration in their misery just increases our _own_ delusion --- which sooner or later will manifest in the form of others seeing _us_ as evil. That's how the cycle is kept going, particularly in the political sphere.

At their root, revenge fantasies stem from the desire to see others pushed further toward evil, so that we can fulfill a primal need: to _see ourselves as good_. It is the same pattern we exemplify any time we choose to see others as _bad_ in some fundamental way, whether or not we overtly wish them harm. To the degree that one can see that one is already fundamentally good --- and so is everyone else --- this crazy strategy of perpetuating evil under the guise of good can come to rest.

In this way, we can recognize the sense in which kindness --- although not necessarily _niceness_ --- is always the right response to any situation, with no exceptions. It is the only motivation that does not produce more delusion --- and therefore suffering --- in oneself and the world.
