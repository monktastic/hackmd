# Radical kindness and the nature of evil

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

The Buddhists believe --- [and it is possible to confirm](www.lifeismiraculous.org) --- that the nature of your mind is pure goodness; unconditional love. The only time you ever misbehave is when you are separated from your true nature by some kind of delusion. The same is true, of course, of everybody else. What we perceive as *evil* in a person is just a measure of this estrangement; it is not a distinct thing in itself. Nonetheless, it is sometimes useful to speak _as though_ it were a real thing.

What makes evil such a perennially intractable problem is that it operates in a fiendishly clever space between the conscious and unconscious. This is very difficult to describe, but I'll try.

There are times when you _knowingly_ act against your conscience[^conscience] by _pretending_ not to hear it. On one hand, you wouldn't be lying if you said that you _can't_ hear it. In a certain sense, all you _consciously_ hear are your mind's clever justifications for why you need not listen; why what you're doing is actually _right_. On the other hand, under certain circumstances --- for example, under the guidance of a strong psychedelic, or perhaps on your deathbed if you're unlucky --- you will be forcefully confronted with the horrifying realization that some part of you _always_ knew that you were being willfully ignorant, and that this knowledge was always _fully conscious_, even while you pretended it wasn't. You will want to fight this realization tooth and nail, but will be completely unable to.

[^conscience]: People often confuse the word "conscience" and "consciousness." Conscience is that in you which knows right from wrong.

In that moment, you will know exactly what it is to be _possessed by evil_. You were _knowingly_ doing wrong while _pretending_ not to know. The world would not be wrong to describe you as evil at that moment (even if only mildly so), and yet there is a legitimate sense in which you really _didn't know_. Do you deserve _contempt_ or _compassion_ in such a state?

You will see clearly that if someone had tried to viciously fight your evil head-on, _they_ would have appeared evil to _you_ --- no matter how right they were --- and you would have simply doubled down on your willful ignorance, vowing to be cruel in return. This is you being driven further from your light; you are witnessing the birth of _new evil_ in the world.

The only way someone can break the spell is by recognizing the telltale signs of possession and getting _underneath_ it. They must find a way to ally with your _true nature as love_ and uproot the darkness. This is compassion. It doesn't have to _look_ like compassion from the outside. Perhaps they had to use a method like shame or [even](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) [violence](https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/the-bigger-the-ego-the-more-vulnerable-we-are-part-4) to accomplish it --- but if so, they had to do this while _completely established in their own light_. This enabled them to "slip around" your darkness without triggering it.

So was the first person _actually_ evil? This question brings us full circle. The only time someone will try to _fight_ your evil is when they, themselves, are possessed by evil. Their conscience knows fully well that this will only result in more darkness, but they are unable to admit this to themselves.

From this perspective, the darkness begins to look eerily sentient. It lays dormant in your mind, quietly scanning the environment for allies. These aren't allies in the conventional sense (i.e., people who share your beliefs). Quite the opposite: it is searching for the "bad people," so that it can "fight" their darkness. Only, it is not actually _fighting_ their darkness; it is using it as the airtight justification it needs to birth _more_ darkness into the world with plausible deniability. And _you_ are its willing vehicle.

Do you see how insanely clever this ruse is? Our society still believes that "victims deserve compassion, while perpetrators don't." How could a perpetrator deserve compassion? That's weak and naive. Only it's _not_. If compassion were understood properly, we would see that it is the _only_ possible way to reduce evil in the world, and that it can take *whatever form it needs* to accomplish this. But we _can't_ understand it properly, because the darkness _needs_ us not to, in order to sustain itself --- which it is presently doing with devastating ease.

If you _really_ want to put an end to evil, you must begin by making _damn_ sure that you're not still acting as one of its unwitting minions, and then learning to wield the blazing sword of compassion wisely. Ironically, the only way to be truly good is by realizing the sense in which you are _not_ better than anyone else.

I say all this as though I've mastered it myself, but far from it. I only hope you'll join me on the path.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
