> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

We perceive others as morally inferior to us for a surprising reason: it's so that we can feel licensed to be unkind to them, which makes them _worse_, thus confirming our superiority.

We call this "fighting evil," but deep down we know that it only creates _more_. We carefully hide this knowledge from ourselves, because otherwise we would be forced to admit that we're not actually better than anyone.

Unfortunately, such self-deception is itself the clearest evidence that we're not, so we must hide that, too, leading to an ever-tightening noose of delusion that collapses in on itself like a black hole. Now, even the _suspicion_ that we may be trapped cannot make it to our consciousness.

This is the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_, and it would be great if we stopped empowering it. We can admit that we've messed up and don't want to hurt anyone anymore.

Of course, you may actually _be_ better than others in a relative sense: perhaps you hold kinder views, or behave better. But in the absence of delusion, this never feels like cause for contempt; only kindness. You may fear that being kind to "bad people" is naïve, or a way to condone evil. But this fear is ultimately another form of the same trap; a trick to justify unkindness.

Kindness does not have to be nice or gentle. It can be as fierce, wrathful, or perhaps even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) as the situation warrants. But others can tell --- even if only subconsciously --- whether your behavior is rooted in Love or hate, and this ultimately makes all the difference. I cannot prove this to you, but luckily the deepest part of you already knows it.

You may wonder why I'm telling you this, since I'm not remotely an exemplar of it myself. I don't quite know, but here's what I would like to see:

It used to be that our evil could find an outlet in a wide range of people and beings: those with different skin colors, religions, etc. Over time, society has mercifully narrowed the set of acceptable targets, but one still remains: "bad people." It's the one group that everyone agrees deserves cruelty, despite our not remotely agreeing on its membership.

Until this last gaping loophole is closed, we can expect the total evil in the world to keep rising, even as we all pretend not to have any complicity in it. Let's at least agree to close that last loophole, so that we can finally begin the long road of healing.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
