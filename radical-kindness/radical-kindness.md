> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle..._ --- (Source unknown)

If you could inspect the very deepest layers of your mind, you would find that at the core is _pure Light_.

When you are close to your Light, you naturally behave in ways that brighten the world. You find clever ways to reunite others with _their_ Light. When dealing with evil, you are better able to perceive the countless causes and conditions that brought it into being, and find creative ways to heal or counteract them. You are able to do this without a trace of malice. Your methods don't necessarily _look_ anything like love or kindness as we commonly understand them, but that's what they actually are --- and you know this clearly.

As you drift away from your Light, something quite different begins to happen: you start trying to _separate_ others from their Light. If this sounds _evil_ and like something you would never do, that's great: it's the first step in realizing just how insidious the process is.

It begins with the darkness impersonating your Light. It knows what you consider right and wrong, and it divides the world neatly into _those who have been wronged_ (the victims) and _those who are doing wrong_ (the perpetrators). It then makes a big display of being _really nice_ to the former and _really cruel_ to the latter. This way, it's totally clear that you're one of the _good guys_. But it has a secret agenda. Unlike the Light --- which uses wisdom and insight to _eliminate_ evil --- it leverages contempt and malice to create _more_ of it.

Part of you knows _perfectly well_ that treating people with contempt only pushes them further into the dark --- along with everyone who witnesses your unkindness, as well as _yourself_. This makes the world _darker_, and not by accident; it's the entire _mission_ of your darkness. Some part of you knows this clearly, yet you will find yourself curiously unable to consciously admit it. Instead, your mind will conjure up a completely compelling story about how your behavior is a net good; how you are only _fighting evil._ Your nominal "allies" will support this story to the degree that _their_ darkness is operating --- creating a sealed bubble of internal validation.

Make no mistake: this behavior is _evil_, and the deepest part of you knows this. You wouldn't be doing it unless you were profoundly frustrated and felt you had no other choice. You don't really _want_ to be unkind, and if the world were a brighter place, you wouldn't have to. It's a horrible plight, and you deserve compassion for it, not judgement. But that's hard to come by in our world. Your enemies just instigate your darkness, and your "allies" also encourage it. This predicament creates cognitive dissonance. You really _are_ a good person, but your behavior is _evil_. Not by anyone else's standards, but by your own --- _if_ you were to inspect your mind carefully enough. And this is the trick the darkness uses to hide itself: by producing a compelling enough cover story, it can ensure you never _do_ inspect your mind carefully enough.

If someone were to self-righteously call you out for your obviously evil behavior --- and moreover, hypocrisy, since everyone can see that you know, even as you vigorously pretend not to --- you wouldn't sagely reflect on their advice and thank them for it. Your darkness would instantly frame them as an enemy --- even though they are right according to your _own_ deepest judgement. This would just give your darkness justification (and motivation) to express more of itself in the future --- which is exactly what it wants.

Part of you can sense that the person doesn't have your best interest at heart. Actually, they don't have _anyone's_ best interest at heart in that moment, despite what their story is telling them. They are under the sway of their _own_ darkness. They are _knowingly_ pushing you further in while trying to get away with it --- which they will, because society agrees that "bad people" deserve malice. Although they are nominally your enemy, their darkness is actually _allied_ with yours to create more of itself.

Round and round this process goes, with each person's darkness triggering and reinforcing (almost) everyone else's, with everyone totally confident that they're being _righteous_. This is the clever trick the darkness uses to spread itself.

> _He who fights with monsters should take care lest he thereby become a monster._
>  --- Nietzsche

Yet some people seem to have the remarkable ability to steer clear of this fiendish trap. When confronted with your darkness, instead of it triggering theirs, it somehow activates their _Light_. They encourage you to confront your own dishonesty in a way that isn't threatening. They may accomplish this through a variety of means that may be nice or not-so-nice, depending on the circumstances. But even when their behavior is profoundly antagonistic to your stated beliefs and aims, part of you can sense that they are somehow allied with your Light.

Though it may not _look_ like it on the surface, this is true kindness. You are being inoculated, and if you manage to stay healthy, you will contribute to _herd immunity_ from the dark. If we manage to achieve this, then _and only then_ will we be able to hash out our differences in a healthy and productive way. Until then, deadlock or war are the only possible outcomes.

We each have the capacity to drift _disturbingly_ far into the dark before realizing that it has ensnared us. We are unlikely to notice it by ourselves (or with the help of our "allies"), because the further into the dark we go, the stronger its distortion field; the more flawlessly it convinces us that we're _right_. We find ourselves increasingly focused on our _ideas_ on how to fix the world, and drifting further from the one thing that actually _has_ this capability: our Light. The more this happens, the _exponentially_ greater the skill and wisdom needed to pull us out, and the more we resist it --- and yet the greater our relief and gratitude when someone (or something) finally does.

Evil really is a problem, and it certainly won't be solved by our being _nice._ Sometimes unconventional methods like shame or even [violence](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) may indeed be necessary. But if you haven't learned to be exquisitely sensitive to whether you are operating from your darkness or your Light, then you will just be unwittingly creating more evil even as you're convinced of your own good. If there is even a _trace_ of self-righteousness or any enjoyment from being unkind, your darkness will be leaking out in countless ways that continually escape your notice, and which you will be unwilling to acknowledge. Despite your consciously stated intentions, your behavior will secretly telegraph to allies and enemies alike that _confronting my darkness is scary; let us hide from the Light together._ It is impossible to overstate just how insidious this is. It must be seen to be believed.

One method for seeing it is to use entheogenic medicines in the appropriate setting. If all goes well, you will be forcefully confronted with what a profound hypocrite you've been. You will see that everything you harshly judge others for is present, in some way or another, within the recesses of your own mind. In fact, in a peculiar sense, the darkness "out there" is actually a _projection_ of the darkness "in here."

You will find that reason you so eagerly seek out the darkness out there is to help you avoid noticing and dealing with your _own_. You discover that as you heal your own, you gain surprising insights into how to deal with others'. You perceive the very mechanism by which contempt and self-righteousness birth new evil, and how your kindness heals it. You are shown the myriad ways in which you've done both, and how they've each manifested in the world in ways you could never have fathomed from your simplistic view of reality. It becomes crystal clear that one of these paths leads to "heaven," and the other, "hell." Not just for you, but for all of us.

If this all sounds hard to believe, well, it gets weirder. I want to share a section of a [poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem/) by Zen master Thich Nhat Hanh (which I recommend reading in its entirety):

> I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,  
> my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.  
> And I am the arms merchant,  
> selling deadly weapons to Uganda.
>
> I am the twelve-year-old girl,  
> refugee on a small boat,  
> who throws herself into the ocean  
> after being raped by a sea pirate.  
> And I am the pirate,  
> my heart not yet capable  
> of seeing and loving.
>
> I am a member of the politburo,  
> with plenty of power in my hands.  
> And I am the man who has to pay  
> his “debt of blood” to my people  
> dying slowly in a forced-labor camp.

Just a poem, right? Here's Zen priest / punk rocker Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.

"Absolutely literally," he says! There's a very good reason that fictional pieces like Andy Weir's phenomenal [The Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) tickle our funny bones. Some part of you _knows_ it's true, even if you can't presently make sense of it.

Hence the Golden Rule. If _you_ were trapped so deeply in the dark that you appeared as evil as the people you presently hate, would you want to be pushed further in or pulled out? On one hand, once you're that far in, most of the layers of your mind will be _reveling_ in the evil, and would indeed have no interest in being "healed." Other people will take this as a clear signal that you neither want nor deserve any kindness --- and if there is even the slightest trace of darkness left in their mind, it will be thrilled to feast on such an easy target without (apparent) repercussion. That way, everyone gets to express their evil, and everyone gets to convincingly pretend that they're _not_[^Equalizer]. Hurray!

[^Equalizer]: This is why revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_ or _Shooter_ are so popular. The "bad guys" are so obviously and one-dimensionally evil that they couldn't _possibly_ deserve any kindness. This activates our bloodlust in a way that few real-world situations can, and helps us feel even more justified in hiding from our Light. How do you think cops and soldiers end up with [tattoos of the Punisher logo](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/police-wearing-punisher-skull-logo-during-protests-marvel-respon/)?

But the very _deepest_ layer of your mind will be silently calling out, praying that there is still grace left in this world. Your Light can be buried, but it _cannot_ be extinguished. Once you're in that deep, only a Buddha or Jesus would have the clarity to consciously acknowledge your fading ember, let alone the wisdom to do anything useful about it, or the courage and strength to go spelunking for it through your maelstrom of darkness. Most of us are far from having such qualities --- and yet there is something deep within us that knows how to guide us in that direction. I would like to do a better job of following my Light, and I hope you'll be there to offer your own kindness when I stumble --- whether you're _nice_ about it or not.
