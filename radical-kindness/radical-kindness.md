# Radical kindness and the nature of evil

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

If you could inspect the very deepest layers of your mind, you would discover --- to your great delight and relief --- that what you want most genuinely in life is to be as loving as humanly possible; the only problem being that _so many things_ seem to be standing in the way. As you approach that blinding Light at your core, several things become clear.

You see that _everybody_ works this way, including the most evil among us. You don't just _believe_ but can practically _perceive_ the near-infinite set of causes and conditions that have contorted their minds to make it seem so profoundly otherwise, both to themselves and others. You are overwhelmed by the burning desire to bring every single person back "home," and see that as monumental a task as this is, it is the _only_ path toward "world peace" or "heaven on Earth" or whatever we should call that state you most truly long for.

As you drift away from your inner Light, these realizations fade and are replaced by increasingly dark beliefs. A small but growing number of people appear to be genuinely _bad_, until almost everyone seems irredeemable. You feel that it's not only okay, but necessary --- even _righteous_ --- to be cruel to such people; to rub their noses in how _bad_ they are. You find yourself feeling ever-more contemptuous and self-righteous, and licensed to behave however you see fit to fix this broken world according to your increasingly distorted standards. In the limit, you become that which you most detest --- and you _revel_ in it.

Most of us spend the vast majority of our time not at one extreme or the other, but somewhere in the middle. From this perspective, it can feel unclear which direction is more authentic --- but deep down, you know perfectly well. The apparent uncertainty is itself a tool of the encroaching darkness; a smokescreen designed to disorient you and draw you deeper in. It is as though the darkness _needs_ you to be confused, to ensure its very survival. From this perspective, it begins to look eerily sentient; as though it has a mind of its own.

The only way to genuinely _fight_ the evil is to expel it from your own mind and return to your Light. From this place, you have clearer insight into how to expel it from others. Sometimes this requires _kindness_ as we usually understand it. But the deeper in a person is, the less well this works. Unconventional tools like shame or even violence may be necessary in extreme cases. These, too, can be radical forms of kindness --- but only if done from the right place. One indicator is that you won't feel the slightest trace of contempt; you will perceive the other as your equal, and hold only the intention to be of genuine service --- though knowing how _best_ to be of service requires wisdom, which takes time to develop.

From the outside, it can therefore seem hard to tell whether any particular behavior is rooted in compassion or evil. Again, that's not because it's _actually_ hard: to someone well-attuned, it is as clear as day. It is only hard for you to the degree that you are "possessed" by the darkness yourself. This supposed difficulty permits you to be willfully ignorant about your actions, pretending that your malice is a form of "radical kindness," though part of you knows better. What is _actually_ happening is that you are using another's darkness as cover to spread your own and calling it "fighting evil." It is anything but.

This is the cleverest trick the darkness has in its playbook, and it gives it an even stronger sense of being sentient: it is getting us to fight each other under the mistaken belief that we're ending evil, when we're really creating more of it --- _exactly_ as it wants. It keeps our attention focused outward, so that as the world grows darker, we become increasingly convinced that it's being orchestrated by some nefarious cabal[^cabal] "out there"; _we_ certainly aren't doing anything wrong. And the more we _are_ to blame, the more confident we become that we're _not_. It is _insanely_ clever.

All of this makes us sound like we're pretty evil ourselves, but that would be the wrong takeaway. First, because even if it were true, our very darkness would carefully shield us from hearing the message. But also because if we _did_ take it seriously, we might turn the contempt on _ourselves_, further exacerbating the problem.

Yes, you do act against your Light sometimes; maybe even often. Yes, this is what other people perceive as evil. Yes, some part of you _knows_ that you're doing this, even as you pretend not to --- and so you could rightly be called a hypocrite. But it's not what you _want_ to be doing. You really do want to see the evil end, not be its unwitting minion. And you already know that there's no way to do that without becoming much more carefully attuned to --- and honest with yourself about --- whether you are truly acting from your Light.

I'm not telling you this because I've mastered it myself. Far from it. I'm only hoping to make 

[^cabal]: I'm not saying that there _isn't_ a nefarious cabal, but the sheer amount of evil they supposedly wield couldn't have accumulated without our participation, and it certainly can't be reversed (let alone ended) by more of the same.

About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
