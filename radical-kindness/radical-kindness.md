# How the darkness gets in

> _He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster..._ --- Friedrich Nietzsche

I think most of us recognize what Nietzsche is trying to warn us about in this quote, but as a society, we still seem to be falling into this trap with horrifying ease.

We believe that it is something that only happens to _other_ people; that if the process were to begin in ourselves, we would surely recognize it right away and put an end to it. We are _good people_, after all, and would never tolerate monstrosity in ourselves.

Unfortunately, that's not _at all_ how it works. The more the darkness has you in its grip, the better it knows your mind, and the more cleverly it impersonates the Light. It encourages you to seek out like-minded people who share your particular strain of darkness, and together form an airtight seal against the world, so that no doubt can penetrate. This means that the more you have succumbed to it, the _less_ you will recognize it.

Luckily, there is a simple and nearly foolproof test you can use to know if the transformation has begun: do you see yourself as better than others? Do you feel self-righteous? Contemptuous? Morally licensed to be cruel --- in particular, to _bad people_?

Of course, there may well be a sense in which you _are_ better than others. Perhaps you make better choices, hold kinder beliefs, etc. But when you are close to your Light, none of that feels like a reason to be contemptuous or self-important; instead, you are profoundly _grateful_ for whatever confluence of circumstances helped you get here, and want nothing more than to share that grace with others.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown
 
From here, you clearly perceive the "great battle" that everyone is fighting, how unfathomably twisted people's minds can get, and how this makes them appear to be not just evil, but _fundamentally_ so. You vow to do your part to fish them out of this unholy mess instead of pushing them further in. You know, unequivocally, that injecting your own darkness into the mix can never reduce the suffering in this world; that it only ever adds to it. And you discover that _contempt_ is the fiendishly clever trick by which the darkness convinces you otherwise.

It tells you that being _kind_ to evil people would be dangerously naïve; that their darkness must be fought with more darkness. But this is exactly the opposite of the truth --- and some part of you already knows this.

Your unkindness never makes things better. Your target just digs in their heels, becomes increasingly certain that _you_ are evil, and vows to return the favor. You act dismayed but are secretly thrilled, because this vindicates your judgement of them, licensing you and your allies to ratchet up your cruelty. _More darkness all around_. This isn't an unfortunate side effect of your "well-intentioned" actions, like you tell yourself; _it is actually the whole point!_ It was all carefully orchestrated by your darkness as a clever ploy to spread itself under the guise of Light. You are only "fighting evil," after all. The more sensitive you become to the presence of darkness in your mind, the more obvious this ruse becomes.

> _The road to hell is paved with good intentions_ --- Proverb

Your "enemies" are not really enemies; your darkness is secretly _allied_ with theirs, to create more of itself. It doesn't actually want to _end_ theirs; it _needs_ it to procreate. And your "allies" are not really your friends, to the extent that they encourage this madness. This is the horrific mechanism by which we each make the world a darker place while flawlessly convinced we're making it better. 

Can you imagine if _billions_ of people did this? Such a world would look pretty dark indeed --- and its poor citizens would never even begin to suspect _why._ It would always appear to be somebody else's fault. People would grow increasingly spiteful of those "bad people" causing it, and ratchet up their own darkness even further. 

Kindness does not have to be naïve; that's just another trick the darkness uses to keep us ensnared. It is not about being _nice_ --- though that may indeed be its most natural expression in many everyday circumstances. Kindness can be as gentle or fierce --- or even violent --- as it needs to get the job done. I can't tell you what kindness looks like from the outside, because it can manifest in almost any form whatsoever. But you will always know from the _inside_. Are you enjoying inflicting harm? Do you feel even a trace of self-righteousness? The more unconventional your methods, the more care you must take that you haven't secretly slipped back into the darkness.

The only way to truly _fight_ evil is to uproot it. The more you uproot it in yourself, the more capacity you have to help others do the same --- and the more they _trust_ you to help them. Knowing the best way to do accomplish this in any given circumstance still requires _wisdom_, which takes time to develop. We may not always have the energy to be compassionate, or the wisdom to know how to implement it, but we can start by recognizing the sense in which it is _always_ the right motivation. And we can learn to identify the telltale signs of _possession by darkness_, and vow to never give it even a single inch of our precious minds --- or those of our friends.

May all beings be free of suffering.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
