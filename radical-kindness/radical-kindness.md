# Radical kindness and the nature of evil

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

There are times when you act against your conscience; that is, against your own deepest judgement. Not necessarily your surface-level judgement: that's mostly just stories you tell yourself to justify your behavior. _He deserved it --- he's a jerk!_ _I've been through a lot --- what's the big deal taking this one little thing?_ Etc. In a very real sense, all you _consciously_ hear are those justifications; you don't hear the quiet entreaties of your conscience.

If someone were to self-righteously call you out in such a moment, you would perceive them as an enemy --- even if (or perhaps _especially_ if) they were entirely correct. _They don't know what I've been through._ _They aren't saints themselves._ _What right do they have to judge?_ Etc. These kinds of interactions just push you further into the dark; they give you newfound justification (and motivation) to act against your conscience in the future. This doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you human.

Nevertheless, there may come a day --- perhaps under the guidance of psychedelic medicine, or maybe on your deathbed --- when the accumulated weight of all those seemingly-insignificant transgressions suddenly becomes too much to bear. In that moment, several things will become painfully clear.

You will be forcefully shown that you always knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, even as you pretended not to know --- and that this knowledge was always _fully conscious_. You will try your usual trick --- _what right do you have to judge?_ --- before sheepishly realizing that it won't fly here. There's no turning away this time.

But the Light isn't here to smite you. It's here to _show_ you something; something you've always known.

Yes, you knew perfectly well that you were doing wrong, but somehow you also _didn't._ The way you accomplished this was by splitting off part of your psyche, foolishly believing that you could hide from the Light. You didn't do this because you're a bad person; you originally did it to avoid some kind of pain. What you needed was _help_, but what you got from the world was mostly contempt.

_Wow, people really are nasty, aren't they, Mr. Infinite Light? Looks like it's just you and me versus the big, bad world!_ But somehow the Light doesn't pat you on the back. It doesn't budge an inch. It just waits patiently. _Oh, sh*t... this is exactly what I've been doing to them, huh?_

You wanted to pretend that "bad people" were somehow fundamentally different from you, when they were really just more ensnared in the same basic trap. Yes, they knew perfectly well that they were doing wrong, but their mind was configured in such a way that this knowledge --- or at least, its true significance --- was carefully pushed out of view. Yes, they were responsible for this painful split and all the horror that resulted, but _you_ also had a choice: do I make this better or worse?

You discover the clever trick your mind uses to justify Option B. Your darkness wants to be cruel to _everyone_, but it knows it can't get away with this: you are still close enough to your Light that indiscriminate malice would instantly alert you to its presence and snap you out of it. It needs to draw you in deeper first, but how? Oh hey, what if we're really nice to the "victims" of the world --- even going so far as to make a grand display of it --- and then really nasty to the "perpetrators"? Yes! Then it will be obvious to everyone[^everyone] that we are the "good guys" who are only "fighting evil!"

[^everyone]: Actually, it will only be obvious to people who identify the "victims" and "perpetrators" in the same way you do. You will be astonished to find that there are people who bucket them differently and therefore think _you're_ being a jerk. But of course, those people are evil...

The truth is, it is not possible to feel contempt or self-righteousness toward _anybody_ while operating from your Light. From that place, you clearly see the "great battle" that everyone faces, and want nothing more than to heal it. Contempt is always, in every case, your darkness _impersonating_ the Light, scanning for a clever excuse to embed its malevolent tentacles deeper into the world. Make no mistake: this is _evil_. But it slips beneath our cultural radar --- which is how we find ourselves in a world that's so badly broken, with everyone making things a little worse while being certain it's all caused by _someone else_.

To be clear: you are not a _bad person_ for participating in this unholy mess. I only believe that when I'm operating out of _my_ darkness. I am no less complicit than you; in fact, I have been forcefully shown numerous ways in which I'm likely _more_. I'm not here to judge you. But I do think there's something we can do about this, together.

We must take back the meaning of _compassion._ The reason we haven't been able to do this is that our darkness has tricked us into believing that it is something _soft_ and _squishy_ and _nice_; something for the victims, but certainly not the perpetrators. What an abysmally naive solution to evil "nice" would be, indeed! But that's not what compassion is.

Yes, compassion may most naturally manifest as _niceness_ in many everyday circumstances. That may even cure mild cases of evil. But the further a person drifts from their light, the more it may take on unconventional expressions. Compassion can be as fierce --- or potentially even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) --- as needed to be to get the job done. Such expressions might be called _radical kindness_. But the more radical our "kindness," the more exquisitely attuned we must be to whether we've secretly slipped back into darkness. Are we enjoying inflicting harm? Is there any trace of self-righteousness? We also need _wisdom_ to know what the right approach is, and that takes time to develop.

The only way to actually _fight_ evil is to uproot it. The more you have uprooted it in yourself, the more ability you have to do this for others. But you must be deeply honest about your own ability. If you try to tackle hard cases prematurely, you run the very real risk getting drawn in by _their_ darkness, and tricked into expressing _yours_ in the name of the Light. This is just what the darkness wants. You will certainly _feel_ like you're "fighting evil" --- and may even be able to produce evidence to justify it --- but you will only adding to the burden of the world, and going down a very dark and slippery road[^road] indeed.

[^road]: One that you've been down [countless times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI), and that always ends with a confrontation with the Light. You already know who's going to win, so why bother?

We will not always have the energy to be compassionate, or the wisdom to know how to implement it. But we can start by consciously admitting that injecting our own darkness into the world can never, under any circumstances, make it brighter. That is a function only your Light can perform.

May all beings be free of suffering.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
