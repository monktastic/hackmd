I've tried to write this piece countless times, but it always comes out wrong. Please take the following as poetry.

---

If we could really see it all, we would never choose to be unkind. *Never*.

We would see that people's bad behavior and ideas are --- without exception --- rooted in profound confusion that even *they* cannot recognize, let alone admit. That our inability or unwillingness to recognize this is a heartbreaking tragedy of epic proportions. That **this** is what keeps the wheel of suffering spinning.

We would clearly see that any decision to overlook a person's fundamental goodness --- be it in the form of ridicule, contempt, or hate --- only pushes them *further* into the dark. We would recognize this as a form of violence, and could take no pleasure in it. We would see that *no good* could ever come from it --- despite the cunning calculations of our infinitely clever minds.

We would discover, with a shock, that somehow *we've always known* this. That we did it anyway, to make ourselves feel better; so that we could keep pretending that evil exists only *out there*: look, I can *see* it! That it's terrifying to confront the darkness within ourselves, and much easier to project it out, where it can be valiantly fought by us, *the good ones*. We would see that ultimately, this primal need to see ourselves as "good" backfires *horrifically*.

We would stop confusing "kind" with "nice." If we found that mockery --- [or worse](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) --- were actually the wisest response to a situation, we would do it with genuine **love** in our hearts. And we would discover that, astonishingly, this made *all the difference in the world*, in ways that we could hardly fathom, let alone predict.

We would see that our *own* bad behavior only ever comes from our own deep confusion --- confusion that *we* could not see, let alone admit. Glimpsing this, we would be gentle with ourselves. We would remember what we truly desire most of all. We would see that remarkably, behind the bewildering array of diversity, everyone else does, too. And we would remember --- at least for a brief time --- how to find our way back home.

### Selected quotes

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* --- Carl Jung

---

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

---

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung

From an online web forum (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

From a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA (emphasis mine):

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. ‚Ä¶ So, my basic view of the world began to shift. ‚Ä¶ Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

> *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago

> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing. Until we make deep peace with such aspects of ourselves, unwanted aspects we don‚Äôt want to see, by learning to receive a love that touches in past them to the intrinsic goodness of our being, we can‚Äôt open to the intrinsic goodness of others that also lies hidden from our view.*
>
> *We need to receive love from those who have sent it to us just as we are, with all our flaws, in order to relax into the deeper goodness within us that always deserves such love and to heal there. Then we can offer a love in turn that embraces others with similar flaws, that touches in on their intrinsic worth, mirrors their goodness back at them, and doesn‚Äôt give up on them no matter what.*

> *Nobody is immune to a nationwide evil unless he is unshakably convinced of the danger of his own character being tainted by the same evil. But the immunity of the nation depends entirely upon the existence of a leading minority immune to the evil and capable of combating the powerful suggestive effect.*
> ...
> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.*
