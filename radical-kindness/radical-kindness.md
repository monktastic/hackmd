> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

We've all had the experience of doing something we know to be wrong while pretending that it's not. Part of your mind knows perfectly well what you're doing, and doesn't want to be doing it. Another part is carefully shielding this knowledge from conscious self-reflection. If you were forced to confront it with full honesty, you would find yourself simply unable to continue.

This same self-deceptive mechanism lies at the heart of _all_ evil. What differs is primarily how deeply it has colonized one's mind. Beyond a certain point, it can appear as though there is _no_ part of the person's mind that wishes to be free of it. This perception is a dangerous trap.

It causes you to try and fight their evil by attacking them, but this generally backfires. They see _you_ as evil in return, which they then feel obligated to fight. This apparent recalcitrance vindicates your perception of them, which justifies escalation. The same process occurs in the minds of bystanders, whichever side they take. Despite whatever temporary suppression of misbehavior you may have accomplished, the net result is a darker world; a greater tendency for unkindness.

What's hard to see is that this is not just an unfortunate side effect of your noble intentions: it was secretly _orchestrated_ by the darkness in your mind. Of course, it doesn't feel that way. Consciously, it just feels like you're "fighting evil." But there's actually something much more insidious going on, which your mind is carefully hiding from you. Sound familiar?

There exists darkness deep within each of us, but it's too painful to confront. So we pretend that it doesn't exist --- or at least, that ours isn't as bad as others'. We then eagerly seek it out in others, and find clever ways to _entrench_ theirs, so that we can maintain our self-image as "good people." But of course, a "good person" wouldn't knowingly entrench evil, so our mind has to very carefully hide this fact from ourselves.

The problem is that everyone else can plainly see our hypocrisy. Our "allies" conveniently overlook it, because this helps them overlook theirs. But our enemies are motivated to expose it. When they perceive you as evil for being unkind, they're not actually wrong --- _regardless_ of whatever they've done. Part of you really _is_ trying to smother whatever little is left of their light, while dressing it up as noble --- which is _exactly_ the kind of self-deception that you are skewering them for in the first place. You may be enemies, but under the surface, your evil shares a common goal: to create _more_ of itself.

You know that literary trope where all the horrors of the world can be traced back to a secret conspiracy hidden in plain sight, but which maddeningly, nobody can see? Well, _this is it._ I am not just sharing an interesting theory; I am pointing at something that you can discover concretely in yourself. No twist ending in any fictional story will ever gobsmack you as hard as the first time you discover that part of you has been in on the "evil conspiracy" all along --- and that this knowledge was always consciously available to you, had you just chosen to look. It is this horrifying epiphany that we're avoiding by staying so fixated on others.

Such an awakening is one door to genuine compassion. It is impossible to appreciate just how hard it is for others to escape their darkness until you uncover the fiendish mechanism by which it has ensnared you despite your best intentions. Yes, others' evil may be worse, but paradoxically, this makes it _harder_ for them to notice and heal, not easier. Seeing this clearly, it is impossible not to feel a burning desire to help free them of this profound mental illness --- this time, without the deluded self-righteousness that was secretly compounding the problem.

> _Such a [person] knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day._ â€” Carl Jung

To truly fight evil, it must be given absolutely nothing to latch on to; no way to justify its own existence via your hypocrisy. The only way to do that is to be free of any desire to be cruel, and that the way to do _that_ is to see the truth clearly: that at the ultimate level, _everyone_ wants to be free of delusion, whether they're consciously aware of this or not. If you can help awaken this aspect of their mind, you've done some good. This is true kindness.

To be clear, kindness isn't always _nice_. It can be as fierce, wrathful, or perhaps even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) as the situation warrants. These could be called _radical kindness._ The greater the evil, the greater the need for such unconventional methods to shock people into confronting what they're doing, or to stop them from doing it --- but also the greater the wisdom required to ensure that we're not falling for the same sinister trap and simply calling it "radical."

It's been said that forgiveness isn't for the other person so much as for yourself. The same is true of kindness. The exhortations to be kind to "bad people" are not a trick to justify weakness or condone evil, but precisely the opposite. It is ultimately the _only_ path toward the world you most deeply long for. You owe it to yourself to discover just how fiercely transformative your kindness can really be.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
