# Radical kindness (take 7)

Both meditation and psychedelics can trigger various kinds of awakenings. Below I discuss one that I think is of particular importance for the survival of humanity.

---

Everything changes the moment you realize that what we perceive as *evil* is really just varying degrees of *delusion.* An undeluded mind naturally desires the best for everyone; people are, in this sense, *intrinsically* good. Healing the world therefore requires *alleviating* this delusion. How do we do this?

Delusion expresses itself through misbehavior. Such behavior is therefore a clear signal for where help is needed most. Unfortunately, we tend to have precisely the *opposite* reaction, which just ends up making the world *darker.* If humanity is to survive, this is the key mistake that must be corrected.

Our first instinct when someone behaves badly is to see them as a *bad person.* This licenses us to treat them cruelly, such as with mockery or shaming. Deep down we know that this will probably only push them *further* into delusion, but our conscious minds find a way to dress it up as *good* or at least *necessary*.

The problem is that everyone recognizes this as hypocrisy, even if only subconsciously. Our target becomes certain that *we're* evil, while bystanders and allies feel empowered to be more malicious themselves. It is as though the darkness within us is invisibly reaching out to ally with the darkness in everyone else---friends and enemies alike---so as to entrench itself more firmly in the world under the guise of *good*, thereby escaping our notice. This has profound long-term consequences that far outweigh any temporary positive effects.

Upon awakening, this "dark alliance" becomes practically *palpable*. Astonishingly, you also discover that you somehow *always knew* that you were doing this, but cleverly hid it from your conscious mind. In retrospect, it feels exactly as though you were *possessed by evil* in those moments but didn't yet have the tools to recognize its insidious operation.

What is the root cause of such possession?

You could not yet see your own intrinsic goodness, so you were scared and ashamed of the dark aspects within you. It is impossible to overstate the lengths our minds will go to to keep our darkness hidden from us in this state. The primary mechanism is to *externalize* it. This means seeking it outside, exaggerating it outside, and projecting our *own* darkness outside. Crucially, it also means that *we must never suspect we are doing any of this* --- which makes writing this piece particuarly challenging.

When we see others as evil, what we are really seeing is their inability to recognize *their* intrinsic goodness. The more evil they appear, the further buried *their* good is. Why is it buried? Because when it was nearer to the surface, other confused people (like us) chose to bury it deeper rather than being of service. Thus our darkness conspires with theirs to perpetuate itself.

The only solution (that I know of) is to have a direct encounter with the fundamental goodness that is the very nature of your mind[^metaphysics]. When this happens, you simultaneously see it in everybody else, too. This suddenly lays bare the entire horrific enterprise and empowers you to finally do something about it.

This does not mean you are out of the woods, by a long shot. It just means that you are beginning to recognize the telltale signs of possession in yourself and becoming capable of "combating its powerful suggestive effect[^Jung1]." And one surefire sign of possession is that *you are choosing to see somebody as bad.* 

The corrective is to recognize them as *good but confused.* When that happens, it is as though the *goodness* in our minds is able to conspire with the goodness in theirs, so as to jointly drive out the darkness. Still, a few things ought to be said about this.

Most importantly, it does not mean that we must tolerate their behavior or respond softly. Compassion does not prescribe or preclude any particular course of action. It is still possible to mock, shame, [or worse](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) with kindness --- though we must be especially on guard for self-delusion in such cases.

Also, sometimes a person is too far gone for us to have any hope of seeing any goodness (at our current level). I'm not sure any good comes of us forcing it or pretending. It is certainly possible for such a person to use our kindness against us, and sometimes the best we can do is to protect ourselves. Putting compassion into effective action requires *wisdom*, and that is certainly not gained overnight, awakening or not. It is the work of a lifetime, and beyond the scope of this piece.

Nonetheless, awakening seems to be a very important first step. This is precisely what meditation was designed for, and what psychedelic medicines are demonstrating remarkable potential for. As more people are inoculated, the virulent cycle that perpetuates evil increasingly becomes unable to sustain itself. And it is difficult to see how humanity can survive without this happening.

May all beings be happy. 🙏🏽

(Also see [quotes](https://hackmd.io/yK1WOQ8oRVeKbLM6QzPX_Q).)

[^Jung1]:
    > *[T]he immunity of the nation depends entirely upon the existence of a leading minority immune to the evil and capable of combating the powerful suggestive effect. ... Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.*
    
[^metaphysics]:  I apologize if this language does not jibe with your conception of reality, but there is simply no better way to put it. This is  why the advancement of metaphysics is critical. Without recognizing the primacy of consciousness, such ideas must be shoehorned into our philosophy in a way that renders them impotent.
