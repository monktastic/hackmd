# One weird trick Evil doesn't want you to know

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

If you could inspect the very deepest layers of your mind, you would discover --- to your unfathomable delight and relief --- that what you want most genuinely in life is to be as loving as humanly possible; to shine your Light as brightly as you can. It turns out that the innermost core of your mind _is_ that very Light. As you approach it, the true nature of good and evil is slowly revealed.

You increasingly see how _everybody_ has this same basic nature, including --- astonishingly --- the most evil among us. You don't just _believe_ but can practically _perceive_ the near-infinite set of causes and conditions that have contorted their minds such that it seems so profoundly otherwise, both to themselves and others. You are overwhelmed by the burning desire to bring every single person back "home," and see that as monumental a task as this is, it is the _only_ path toward "world peace" or "heaven on Earth" or whatever we should call that state you most deeply long for.

As you drift away from your Light, these realizations fade and are gradually replaced by dark illusions. People begin to appear not only _bad_, but _intrinsically_ so. It therefore becomes not only acceptable, but necessary --- even _righteous_ --- to be cruel in order to fight them. You find yourself feeling ever-more contemptuous and self-righteous, and licensed to behave however you see fit to fix this broken world according to your increasingly distorted standards --- which you do not _realize_ are distorted. Eventually, you become that which you most detest --- and you _revel_ in it.

Most of us spend the vast majority of our time not at one extreme or the other, but somewhere in the middle. From this perspective, it feels unclear which direction is more authentic --- even though deep down, you know perfectly well. That feeling of uncertainty is itself a tool of the encroaching darkness; a smokescreen designed to disorient you and draw you deeper in. The darkness _needs_ you to be confused, to ensure its very survival. From this perspective, it begins to look eerily sentient; as though it has a mind of its own.

Some part of you already knows that your cruelty never makes the world better. When you are unkind, your target simply digs in their heels, sees _you_ as evil, and vows to be cruel in return. You act dismayed, but are secretly relieved. It provides you with a hit of dopamine: you were _right_ about them; you and your allies really _are_ the good guys, and you are now licensed to be even _more_ cruel. _More darkness all around._ Your conscious mind tells you that this is just an unfortunate side effect of your "good intentions," but it's not: it is secretly _the whole point!_ Your darkness carefully orchestrated the entire thing, so that it could create _more_ of itself under the guise of the Light. It is _playing_ you.

> _The road to hell is paved with good intentions_ --- Proverb

Of course, nobody can _tell_ you this, least of all while you're in the midst of doing it. You would immediately become suspicious of their intentions, no matter how pure or true. Are they [tone policing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_policing) you? Are they telling you not to fight evil? Are they siding with the bad person? Are they simply naive? Whatever it is, they, too, become an enemy. But this suspicion is _also_ a tool of the darkness, and it hinges on a nefarious lie: that _kind_ is the same as _nice_.

True kindness has nothing to do with being nice --- even if that is its most natural expression in many everyday circumstances. Kindness can be as gentle or fierce --- or potentially even [_violent_](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) --- as necessary to get the job done. Such manifestations could be called _radical kindness_ --- though the more radical your "kindness," the more care required to ensure that your darkness hasn't secretly regained control.

It is impossible to say what kindness _looks_ like from the outside, because it can take on almost any form whatsoever. And yet, you will always know from the inside. Is any part of you enjoying inflicting harm? Do you feel the slightest trace of contempt or self-righteousness? When executed flawlessly, it is almost as though your minds _fuse_[^oneness], jointly seeking the most rapid path back Home.

[^oneness]: Or perhaps the more you realize that you were [never separate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI).

> _Whoever fights monsters should take care lest he thereby become a monster_ --- Nietzsche

The process of becoming a monster is _insanely_ insidious, and it's almost impossible to detect in yourself without extreme vigilance --- which is, unfortunately, often learned "the hard way." Nobody else can make you aware of it, either, due to the defense mechanism mentioned above. The only way for someone else to get through to you is by showing _you_ great kindness. They must perceive what has separated you from your Light, and generate conditions that encourage you to return. Again, this may not _look_ anything like "kindness" from the outside. In fact, the further you have strayed, the less it probably will --- and yet, some part of you will know. This is the same gift you will increasingly have to offer others.

The only way to truly fight evil is by uprooting it. The more you have done this in your own mind, the greater your ability to perceive what is preventing it in others, and to help them do the same. The _less_ you have uprooted the darkness in your own mind, the more you will continually leak it out into the world, utterly convinced that you are doing good. Can you imagine if _billions_ of people were doing this? Such a world would look very dark indeed, with everyone pointing fingers at each other, never suspecting their own complicity.

Kindness is _always_ the right motivation in every circumstance, with no exceptions. The only reason we ever believe otherwise is that we have begun to slide into the darkness ourselves. In that place, we become disoriented and vulnerable to its lies, which tell us that kindness is weak and naive, while cynicism, contempt, and malice are strong. This is a powerful illusion, indeed. It is therefore now especially vital to remember our Light, not _despite_ how dark our world is becoming, but _because_ of it. We _must not_ create more.

I tell you this not because I am a bastion of alignment myself. Far from it. And if what I have said so far is true, then the only way I can be of benefit is by _becoming_ better aligned --- not by _writing_ about it. And yet, I find that having this mental model helps orient me toward this goal. I hope it does for others, too.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
