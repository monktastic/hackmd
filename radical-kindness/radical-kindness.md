# Radical kindness and the nature of evil

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

Many years ago, I encountered a realization that shattered my understanding of good and evil. Although the experience was deeply personal, some of the lessons may be universal. Therefore I have chosen to write it in the second person. 

May it be of benefit to someone, somewhere.

There are times when you act against your conscience; that is, against your own deepest judgement. Not necessarily your surface-level judgement: that's mostly just stories you tell yourself to justify your behavior. _He deserved it --- he's a jerk!_ _The world has been cruel to me, so I deserve to take this little thing._ Etc. In a very real sense, all you _consciously_ hear are those justifications; you don't hear the quiet entreaties of your conscience.

If someone were to self-righteously call you out in such a moment, you would perceive them as an enemy --- even if (or perhaps _especially_ if) they were entirely correct. _They don't know what I've been through._ _They aren't saints themselves._ _What right do they have to judge?_ Etc. Those kinds of interactions just push you further into the dark; they give you newfound justification (and motivation) to act against your conscience in the future. This doesn't make you a bad person. It just makes you human.

Nonetheless, there may come a day --- perhaps under the guidance of psychedelic medicine, or maybe on your deathbed --- when the accumulated weight of all those seemingly-insignificant transgressions suddenly becomes too much to bear. In that moment, the astonishing truth about good and evil will be laid bare.

You will be forcefully shown that you always knew _perfectly well_ that you were doing wrong, even as you did it --- and that this knowledge was _entirely conscious_. You will try to bargain, cajole, and plea your way out of this horrifying realization, but find that your conscience is the one thing that cannot be bargained with. You are inescapably guilty --- and worse, a hypocrite.

At the same time, you will see that this somehow does not contradict the fact that you _didn't_ know. The only way you could do wrong was by splitting off part of your psyche. You didn't do this because you're _bad_; you originally did it to avoid some kind of pain. This state is a kind of _schizophrenia_[^schizophrenia], and it is inherently unpleasant --- even though you are not consciously aware of this. What you needed was _help_. The more lost you got, the more help you needed, but the less it _looked_ like you needed help. You simply looked _bad_, and got pushed in even harder.

[^schizophrenia]: I mean this in its original Latin sense of "splitting of the mind," not the DSM condition.

You see clearly that this is how _all_ evil works. People know perfectly well when they're doing wrong, and yet their mind is configured in such a way that this knowledge --- or at least, its true significance --- is carefully hidden from them. This is what it feels like to be _possessed by evil_: the surface layers of your mind know you're being evil (and may even _revel_ in it), but deep beneath the surface, your "true self"[^true-self] --- the _Light_ --- is helplessly watching the horror unfold. As the possession intensifies, it recedes ever-further out of view, until it can no longer be seen by you or others --- but it can never be completely extinguished.

[^true-self]: You may wonder: sure, _my_ true self is on the good side of the split, but how do I know that _theirs_ isn't on the evil side? This is a hard question to answer, but it indeed gets resolved conclusively in the experience. Here I can only offer some intuition:

    1. Nobody ever breaks down, cries, and has a deep moment of truth in which they say: "I wish I had kicked more puppies." That's not a thing.
    2. [Read](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) or [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) The Egg by Andy Weir. It is approximately correct.

All this time, did you deserve _contempt_ for your evil and hypocrisy, or _compassion_ for your horrific plight? You realize that this is the wrong question.

Regardless of what you "deserved," you see clearly why the contempt didn't work. It _couldn't_ work. It was never _supposed to_ work! The people who treated you this way were possessed by their own darkness. Their behavior was designed to help them avoid their own guilt by focusing on yours. They knew perfectly well that this would only add to the burden of the world --- but they also _didn't_ know. All they _consciously_ felt was that they were "fighting evil" --- and how could that ever be wrong? Even the people cheering you on for your misbehavior --- your nominal "allies" --- could only do that while possessed.

From this vantage point, the darkness begins to look eerily sentient. It knows the finest details of our minds, and how to convince us to do its bidding --- often while flawlessly convinced that we're doing good. It plays us off each other, keeping our attention outward so that we never catch on to its tricks, or to our own complicity. We gleefully push each other further in, all the while wringing our hands over the sorry state of the world.

What we normally call "fighting evil" is anything but: it's actually _their_ darkness triggering _ours_ by resonance --- like two tuning forks --- so that the two may synchronize and amplify their malevolent tune. The only way to avoid getting sucked in is by standing steadfastly by your own Light. This is called compassion.

It is about refusing to give in to the siren call of darkness. The more firmly you do this, the louder your Light resonates. The more it pierces the veil of their possession, enabling you to perceive the tiny, remote aspect of their mind that still wants --- and deserves --- to be rescued. You must find a way to _recruit_ that part, so that it joins the fight from the inside. This is the only true way to fight evil: by uprooting it, thus healing the split.

It is impossible to say what compassion _looks_ like from the outside, because it can take any form it needs. And yet, from the inside, you will always know. There will be no trace of contempt; only the firm intention to be of service. This intention must be paired with _wisdom_, the knowledge of what will work and what won't. There may well be times when the expression must be fierce, or perhaps [even](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) [violent](https://www.matthieuricard.org/en/blog/posts/the-bigger-the-ego-the-more-vulnerable-we-are-part-4). Other times, the person may simply need to have some basic needs met. Such wisdom takes time to develop, and is beyond our present scope.

As you see all this, you realize that your Light isn't here to judge or smite you; indeed, it is the one thing that will never forsake you. It _can't_ --- because you _are_ it. This whole time, you were only ever hiding from yourself. How silly to imagine that this could have ever worked! How crazy to have wanted anything more than to be back here, your true Home. You see clearly that this is what _everyone_ wants, whether they know it or not.

What a relief to realize that the best way to guide everyone else back is to guide _yourself_ back to what you truly want most.

About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
