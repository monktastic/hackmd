> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

Most of us instinctively understand and appreciate this quote, but we find ourselves making exceptions. Some people's behavior is not due to any "great battle." They are knowingly _choosing_ to do wrong, and being kind would be foolish. Our political foes are an obvious example.

This is an insidious trap. If you start taking these exceptions seriously, you will find yourself making more and more of them --- until one day there are more exceptions than not. As this progresses, _you_ become that "exception" for more and more people, but you can't understand why. It must be that _they're_ evil. 

This should be a glaring clue as to what's really going on, but astonishingly, we can't see it. At some level we understand that this is the dark path that _every_ evil person has slid down, but we think we're somehow special --- and that's actually the root of the whole problem.

The dividing line between "good people" and "bad people" does not exist in reality. It exists only in your mind, and serves only one purpose: to provide your own malevolent urges with "fair game" to feast on. Of course, it doesn't _feel_ like that. It feels like we're being _righteous_; only _fighting evil._ But this is the entire trap: being evil _never_ feels wrong.

We've all had the experience of doing something we know to be wrong while pretending that it's not. Part of our mind knows perfectly well what we're doing --- and doesn't want to be doing it --- while another part is pretending _not_ to know. The same is true of "bad people." They certainly know that they're doing wrong, but that knowledge --- or at least its true import --- is also carefully shielded from conscious self-reflection.

In other words, they simultaneously _know_ and _don't_ --- just like you both know and yet somehow don't. You get to choose which side you empower, both in yourself and others. When you choose to empower your dark side, you are choosing to empower theirs. These two things always go hand-in-hand. It is as though reality is a mirror: when you punch it, it _always_ punches back. If enough of us punch the mirror, what we get is war. We're edging ever closer in the US now.

One trick our darkness uses to convince us of the necessity of unkindness is to misunderstand what kindness is. It is not about being _nice._ Kindness can be as fierce, wrathful, or perhaps even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) as the situation warrants. But paradoxically, these can all be performed with genuine _love_ --- and this ultimately makes all the difference. I cannot convince you of this, but the deepest part of you already knows it.

It has been said that forgiveness is not so much for the other person as for yourself. The same is true of kindness. On the other hand, the mirror-like nature of reality makes it so that kindness for others ultimately _is_ kindness for yourself. May we swiftly realize this and stop punching the mirror.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> _Such a [person] knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day._ â€” Carl Jung

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
