> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

We've all had the experience of doing something that we know to be wrong while pretending that it's not. The part that knows it's wrong doesn't want to be doing it, but is drowned out by a louder voice justifying it. _All_ evil works through various forms of this same self-deception. There is always a part of the mind --- however tiny and remote --- that doesn't want to be doing it.

In one sense, evil _hates_ to be confronted directly: when you contemptuously accuse someone of being evil, far from thanking you for your insight, they tend to see _you_ as evil in return, and double down on their own delusion. In other words, they become a little _more_ evil.

On a deeper level, far from hating this, it is **exactly** what their evil wanted: your decision to be evil provides them with airtight justification to be malicious in return.

On the surface, you will find this ridiculous. You weren't being evil. You were just trying to help; to _fight_ evil. If they reacted poorly, that's entirely on them. Alas, what can one expect from such a bad person? But again, on a deeper level, you will find something much more sinister going on.

It turns out they're not actually wrong: what you did really _was_ evil. The darkness in you _wanted_ to provoke theirs, to "morally" justify escalation of cruelty. Here's the shocking thing: your darkness can actually _perceive_ that the tiny remote still-decent part of them is being brutally victimized by their evil --- and it is eagerly seizing its chance to join the malevolent feast, because it knows it will be cheered on by our dysfunctional society. "Fighting evil," indeed.

Again, on the surface, you will find this absurd and maybe even offensive. Far from thanking me for my insight, you will think I'm crazy or evil. But if you inspect your mind carefully enough, you will see that you knew all of this in advance, and _they_ knew you knew, and _you_ knew they knew you knew, etc. The whole sordid dance was secretly prearranged --- not exactly by either of you, but by the darkness in _both_ of your minds.

It is an evil conspiracy, and our minds are in on it.

On one level, you know perfectly well that this is how it works. Astonishingly, under certain circumstances (such as some entheogenic trips, near-death experiences, or deep meditation), it becomes possible to see that this knowledge was always _conscious_ in you --- you just willfully overlooked it because, well, humans.

Does this mean we _shouldn't_ confront evil directly? Of course not. The key word in the second paragraph is "contemptuously." People who have overcome their own self-deception are never self-righteous, because they've consciously perceived the astonishing sense in which we are all the same. This realization comes through in their words and behavior, giving the other person's evil absolutely nothing to latch onto to further justify its existence. This weakens it, and correspondingly strengthens their light --- even if it doesn't immediately show. Such behavior is true kindness, even if its outward manifestation must sometimes be fierce, wrathful, or even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/). This is the only way to actually _fight_ evil instead of just pretending to.

Self-righteousness is _always_ self-deception. Part of you _knows_ the profound sense in which you are ultimately not better than anyone --- evil people included --- but chooses to focus on the comparatively surface-level ways in which you are. Not to help anyone, but to elevate itself at the expense of others and justify cruelty. It is extreme hypocrisy to condemn others from this place, and even more so to blame them for calling us out on it --- or to expect them to act any better in response.

To be completely clear: you are not doing any of this because you are a _bad person_. I'm certainly no better. If I believed that, I would be committing the very same egregious error. What you ultimately are is impossibly kind. You just have to remember it.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> I saw the lies and self-deception I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it.
>
> I [felt] the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them. At the same time I also saw that they have their own lies and self-deceptions.
>
> The result was that I felt like a failure as a person. I wasn’t the person I had thought I was. It was humiliating. I felt really dreadful and it was completely humbling.
>
> The judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source. But then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.

> The entire experience gave me a second chance to live a more meaningful life. I felt I had a chance now to change things so that the next time I get back to the life review it wouldn’t be the same or at least they would say, “He tried.”
