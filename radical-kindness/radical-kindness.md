Most people seem to intuitively understand this sentiment. Yet we often have difficulty putting it into practice. Consider the realm of political discourse. Is it more common to see each side being kind to the other, or sanctimonious and bitter? How do we account for this enormous discrepancy between what we believe and how we behave?

A partial explanation is that when we're triggered, it's harder to live according to our values. But even when we have calmed down, it often feels natural to view the other side as fundamentally morally deficient instead of merely caught in a "great battle." While it's possible that some small percentage of people really *are* intrinsically bad, this surely doesn't account for *all* the people we exclude from our kindness.

Something much more interesting is going on. It's been written about countless times before (so I claim no credit), but it can't be said enough. I'll phrase it as a theory, but if you look very sincerely you will see it plain as day.

Humans have a primal need to see ourselves as *good*. The problem is, there are all sorts of circumstances that could cause us to behave very badly indeed. This terrifies us. So instead of confronting the darkness within, we project it outwards onto others. It's not that they don't have it too; it's that we *exaggerate* it in them so that it seems correspondingly smaller in us.

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung, On Psychic Energy

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

Avoiding our own issues is unhealthy, of course, but there's an even bigger problem: by projecting darkness, we create more of it.

Consider what it feels like when someone who you don't already respect tries to make you feel like a _bad person_. Doesn't this just make you dig in your heels and vow to return the favor? You don't do this because you're *right*; you do it because that's how humans work.

We know that this is how our enemies work too, but because they're our enemies, we take *pleasure* in seeing them plunged further into darkness. They *deserve* it, given how *bad* they are. And thus we enhance the polarity that ensures we can see ourselves as good.

Remarkably, we create darkness even when we're not directly communicating with them. Our friends *also* recognize that the desire to see others as bad is fundamentally *violent*. I'm not talking about somber, sober discussions we may have about how to deal with genuine problems. I mean the way we bond over what nasty people *they* are.

Of course, if we consciously realized we were creating darkness, it would defeat the whole purpose (of seeing ourselves as good). That's what makes people so resistant to admitting it, even to themselves. In fact, how strongly one denies this dynamic is a good indicator for how much it is operating in them. Ultimately, this resistance is what perpetuates the discrepancy between our beliefs and behavior.

So what can be done about it?

There is a particular realization that can be had, whether through life experience, meditation, or even plant medicines such as *psilocybin*. The following quote from an online forum captures the experience well (emphasis mine):

About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged.

Do you find yourself "denying the similarity" with yourself? If so, ask your doctor if *magic mushrooms* are right for you! Joking aside, here's a similarly powerful quote from a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA:

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

In other words, I only do bad things because of deep confusion. Upon seeing this, one can directly perceive precisely the same dynamic operating in everyone else, too. And in that moment, it becomes crystal clear why kindness is the only logical response to *any* situation. It has nothing to do with being "nice." It is simply being ruthlessly honest about what I am and what everyone else is, and being tired of creating more darkness in the name of light.

Unfortunately, this is not a "one and done" deal. But through repeated perception of this profound insight, one can eventually be free of the mistaken

1. True kindness is about seeing clearly, and in that way it is *never* wrong. [x]
2. Seeing clearly is about recognizing the sense in which we are fundamentally the same as others. [x]
    - People are only bad due to confusion.
4. It *takes* darkness to *see* darkness. Therefore, seeing darkness in others is a powerful reminder to look at oneself.
5. We do it anyway, to fulfill a primal need: to see ourselves as good. 
6. This causes our enemies to see us as *bad*, resulting in a vicious cycle that is only ended through clear seeing.
    - Therefore, the choice to see darkness results in *more* darkness, not less.

I'll unpack each below.

Think of the kindest person you know. How do they react to a minor injustice --- say, being cut in line? Now think of the nastiest person you know. How do they react to the same situation? What are the short- and long-term effects of the different responses? You may find it obvious that kinder people react more kindly, but there is a deeper lesson in here.

(
1. It's not that both people are equally triggered, but the kind person chooses to suppress. They're less triggered, because they see this as a good person making a mistake. A nasty person sees darkness in the world more easily, because they know exactly what darkness looks like. 

    This provides an effective strategy for being kinder: when you are triggered, recognize that there's a corresponding darkness that lives somewhere within you. When you see this aspect clearly, and what causes it, you will have a _much_ better idea of what will heal the person who triggers you, as opposed to suppressing their behavior and kicking the can down the road.

    This approach requires considerable patience with yourself, since your first reaction will be to vigorously deny that any such thing could exist in you. This denial will be correspondingly more forceful the worse the injustice (because, of course, the more it says about *you*).

2. Kindness is the more effective long-term strategy, despite our intutions --- especially in the moment (when we're triggered), and especially as the injustices become more serious.

    Seeing someone as a "bad person" and reacting to that ultimately causes much more harm 
 
)

Consider the perspective of the "cutter." If they are aggressively put in their place, are they more likely to realize the error of their ways or to stew over it? Even if that particular behavior gets suppressed, isn't the underlying issue likely to manifest itself in other ways?

What if they are treated with kindness --- as though they are a good person who simply made a mistake? Regardless of whether it produces an immediate effect, this kind of response can plant a seed deep in the mind that will sooner or later blossom. _Someone saw the good in me, even when I was acting out._

It's tempting to think that this only works for _minor_ injustices, or only on "good people." But I think this is a big mistake.

# Radical kindness (take 1)

Being kind matters. Everyone knows that. But it matters *especially* when dealing with "bad people" --- and I think that's an important lesson that society hasn't learned yet.

It's easy to understand why we should be kind to victims. It's much harder to see why we should be kind to perpetrators. Intuitively, we feel that this would just empower them. But this mistaken intuition comes from a profound misunderstanding of what kindness *is*.

Kind is not the same as *nice* --- which is merely about being pleasant or agreeable, without regard to outcome. One can be kind without being nice (e.g., tough love), and nice without being kind (sometimes called "idiot compassion," of which *enabling* is one example). Instead, we might define kindness as the opposite of malice: the intention to be of benefit in the world, whatever form that might take. In this sense, it is never the wrong attitude.

Genuine kindness stems from a sort of radical honesty. It requires recognizing and admitting a deeply uncomfortable truth: that the darkness I see in the world lives within me, too. This truth is so uncomfortable that we push it out of our conscious minds, and recoil at its mere suggestion. It takes significant inner work to feel safe enough to allow it back into our consciousness, where it can be processed properly.

What is it like to be confronted with this realization? The following quote from an online forum captures the experience well (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged.

To the degree that one has had this revelation, one's entire outlook on "good" and "bad" is profoundly transformed. This transformation is captured well in the following quote, this time by a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA:

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way… a white screen with some dark spots.***

We see that this is not only true of *us*, but of *everyone*. This, in turn, radically alters how we interact with the world. Instead of seeing ourselves as "good people" valiantly trying to defeat the bad, we discover a much more subtle and profound strategy: it is as though the fundamental good in our own minds is able to commune with the good in others', so as to ally together and jointly drive out the darkness. There is tremendous heartache as we discover just how much damage we had previously been causing in the name of good --- and just how deeply ingrained that pattern still is in society at large.

To get a hint of why it is so damaging, reflect on how easy it is to pick up on sanctimony from another person, and how powerfully that triggers our defense mechanisms. Are we more likely to consider such a person's perspective or to see *them* as bad in return? Conversely, reflect on a time when you were acting poorly and yet someone gave you the benefit of the doubt — particularly when others were unwilling or unable to. Did it not stir the goodness in you, as though rising to their vision of what's possible? At our core, we are *all* like that.

When we attack the darkness in others, we only entrench it. This has the effect of confirming to ourselves that we are good people and they are bad --- which is actually why our egos adopted this counterproductive strategy in the first place. It is as though the *darkness* in our own minds is communing with the darkness in theirs, so that this shadowy principle may entrench itself more firmly in both hosts — a strategy that is remarkably effective, given how well it evades our notice. We convince ourselves that we are doing *good*, though part of us secretly knows better.

After such an awakening, this horrific enterprise becomes practically *palpable*. While it certainly does not immediately free one from continuing to perpetuate this tragic mistake oneself, it is thereafter always accompanied by at least a subtle recognition of one's true egoic motivations.

In this way, one discovers how it is intrinsically joyful to uplift others, and conversely, painful to put them down. From this, it becomes crystal clear that others, too, are ultimately only unkind when their minds are deeply confused — even when surface indications seem to suggest otherwise. It is a heartbreaking revelation: nobody would actually *want* to be unkind, if only they could see clearly the harm it causes them — and yet, they can't seem to help themselves; and in response we cannot help *our*selves; in a never-ending feedback loop. Seeing this, one can no more hate others for such unskillful behavior than one could hate one's own child for inflicting self-harm, even when it also harms others. Such hatred would simply be more of the very problem one is trying to solve, and one is fed up with adding to the enormous load of our species.

One does not gain any Brownie points or become a "good person" for realizing any of this. Instead, being unfailingly kind is its own reward: it is merely the most straightforward way to accomplish what is clearly the most meaningful goal of all, and what the heart ultimately desires most: the end of suffering.
