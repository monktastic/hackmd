> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

It is impossible to make the world better by withholding your love. This isn't something I can prove, but because you already know it deep down, reminders can be helpful. I'm far from being a role model, and need these reminders myself.

The Buddhists believe --- [and it is possible to confirm](www.lifeismiraculous.org) --- that the nature of your mind is pure goodness; unconditional love. The only time you ever misbehave is when you are separated from your true nature by some kind of delusion. The same is true, of course, of everybody else. What we perceive as *evil* in a person is just a measure of this estrangement; it is not a distinct thing in itself --- sort of like how darkness is merely the absence of light.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.* --- Martin Luther King, Jr.

But evil has an unfortunate additional property: seeing it as a "real thing" --- that is, a *presence* instead of an *absence* --- creates *more* of it.

When we perceive it as a presence, we feel self-righteous, and treat the person with contempt. Consciously, we tell ourselves that our malice is not only justified but *righteous* --- we are, after all, only fighting evil.

What's actually happening is that their darkness has triggered ours. This separates us from our light; makes us a little evil ourselves. Far from our darkness fighting theirs, the two are secretly allied. In fact, it is more like two tentacles of the same shadowy organism, embedding itself deeper into each host's mind. This affects everyone around us, too, consciously or not. Our "allies" may cheer us on, but their minds, too, have become darker. Despite whatever temporary good may come from our words and actions, the net result is a darker world.

Of course, it never *feels* like we've become evil --- and that's **exactly** the point.

Humans have a primal need to know our own goodness. When we are separated from our *absolute* goodness, we are forced to seek it *relatively*. This means we need to see ourselves as *better* than others. This compels us to seek out people who we can justifiably feel superior to --- and then to *ensure that they stay there*.

Don't we already know that treating our enemies with contempt will just push them further into the dark and make them double down? We may tell ourselves that this is just an unfortunate side-effect, but it's actually *the true purpose*. Even if we manage to kill them in this state, it's not like that darkness just disappears from the world. Pardon my woo, but it just ripples out and finds new homes.

Of course, we must never consciously suspect that we're darkening the world, because that's would defeat the whole purpose (of seeing ourselves as *good*). So it must be done in a way that preserves our self-identity as "good people." Our darkness knows all this. So it whispers exactly the right things into our minds to convince us that it's *good.*

Being evil while pretending that it's good: isn't that the very *definition* of hypocrisy that we skewer others for? This is really important to see. The *form* differs from person to person, but the dynamic is always the same.

At this point, one of two things can happen. If the conditions are right, we can be deeply honest about what's happening, and reverse course (with a shudder). But in the wrong conditions --- e.g., in the presence of self-righteous enemies --- we feel compelled to double down ourselves. Our darkness has triggered theirs, which in turn triggers ours again. After only a few cycles of this, both sides are so deeply entrenched in being malicious while *increasingly convinced* that we're doing good, that only a saint could provide the necessary conditions to pull us out. The further in we are, the harder it is to see it.

It is difficult to overstate just how frighteningly quickly this process can overtake a person. The darkness is *insanely clever,* and will find whatever hooks present themselves in a mind. It doesn't happen because they are intrinsically bad. If we have avoided getting sucked in, it's not because we are intrinsically better. It's a horrifying process to go through, and even if the end result is someone we can only see as an "evil person," hating them for it just contributes to the whole nasty game. Nobody originally *wanted* to get trapped in this way.

We don't recognize it, but we should be *immensely grateful* for whatever conditions have allowed us to stay relatively near the surface. We think it's all our doing --- because we're *good people* --- but this is the ultimate trap. It is the core belief that enables you to see others as beneath you, thereby preserving you as a player in this sordid game. Ironically, the only way to be *genuinely* good is to realize that you're *not* better than anyone.

With this insight, one increasingly perceives evil as the absence that it is, and realizes that the only solution is to add enough love in the right places to heal it. Such "love" is not a mushy, gooey feeling of *liking* or *tolerating* anyone. It has nothing to do with being *nice*, either. It can be as fierce --- or even [ostensibly violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) --- as needed. This makes it impossible to describe exactly what love *looks like*: there is no specific form that it must take. But you know exactly what it *feels* like, because it is your true nature. The skill of applying it wisely takes a lifetime (or more) to master, and is beyond the scope of this piece.

Often, we remind ourselves to do this through perspective-taking: we try to imagine what circumstances could have turned this person into who they are now. This is a powerful practice, but has a major shortcoming: sometimes, we cannot conceive of *any* circumstances that could have made a person this evil. When this happens, we resort to seeing them as *intrinsically bad*, and we're back in the same trap.

The only way to avoid this is by having unshakeable certainty that it is universally true: that at the ultimate level, nobody actually *wants* to be evil, and that only love can ever heal it. Such universals do not fit neatly into our standard worldview, which is why I find it so crucial that we find a way to [expand our view to fit the truth](www.lifeismiraculous.org). Without this, we will always be able to find supposed exceptions, and the cycle will never end.

The truth is that we cannot make the world a better place by withholding our love. Our attempts to do this are backfiring spectacularly --- just look at the increasing political divide in the U.S. May we figure this out before it is too late.
