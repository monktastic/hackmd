# Radical kindness

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

We've all had the experience of doing something that we know to be wrong while pretending that it isn't. The part of us that knows  it's wrong doesn't actually want to be doing it, but is drowned out by a louder voice justifying it.

It is as though we are under a spell. Others can sometimes break this spell by piercing through our self-deception, to the part of us that doesn't want to do wrong. This is an act of kindness. Its manifestation may be fierce, wrathful, or even violent (as the situation warrants), but it is kindness nonetheless.

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

Often our misbehavior is met not with any form of kindness, but with contempt or malice. This triggers our defense mechanisms, which in turn strengthens our self-deceptive tendencies --- making us _more_ likely to misbehave in the future. The person was trying to _reduce_ evil in the world, but accidentally increased it.

But it wasn't an accident at all. Part of them knew clearly that this would only darken the world; in fact, not only _knew_ it but _intended_ it. That part _enjoys_ pushing other people down to make themselves look good. Normally this would be considered evil, but not when it's done to _bad people_.

Bad people are different from us. _We_ only do bad things because our hand was forced by difficult circumstances; other people do bad things because they're _bad_. It's not only acceptable but righteous to treat such people with contempt. How else will they learn?

But of course, this isn't true.

> _We judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions._ --- Stephen Covey, paraphrasing the Fundamental Attribution Error.

All evil works in essentially the same way. Part of the person's mind knows exactly what they are doing; that it is wrong; and that they don't want to be doing it. Another part is justifying the whole thing. And every interaction either pushes them further into the dark, or helps pull them out.

I won't be able to convince you of this. If you don't already see it, it's because part of your mind won't _let_ you see it yet. It would mean that you're responsible for so much more of the darkness out there than you realize. But it gets worse. I don't know how to express this next part without metaphor.

The mental split that gives rise to misbehavior is intrinsically painful, even though we may not be aware of this. It is as though the evil part of our mind has imprisoned the good part. By the time a person's behavior rises to the level of "evil," the good part is trapped in a living hell. This will not be visible from the outside, and even the person himself will not be consciously aware of it. But the "good part" of their mind is desperately calling out for help.

I'm not trying to tell you that people don't have free will, or that evil people don't deserve to be trapped in the living hell they brought upon themselves. But the really dark thing is that we can _perceive_ this clearly, even when the bulk of our mind willfully overlooks it. When we treat "bad people" with contempt, what we are secretly doing is stepping on the fingers of the "good part," hoping to silence its cries for good. We want to extinguish light from the world and get away with it.

This is _profoundly evil_. So evil, in fact, that there's no way you will believe it.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ â€• Reinhold Niebuhr (author of the Serenity Prayer)

So let me dial it back a bit. Whenever you're feeling self-righteous, be on extra special lookout for any self-deception operating within your mind. If you are honest enough with yourself, you will always find it --- because sanctimony is a foolproof indicator that it is at work.

I'm not claiming to have a solution to the problem of evil. But it would be _extremely_ foolish to trust anyone who believes they do have a solution for the evil in others' minds before they've become acutely (and painfully) aware of the astonishing self-deception lurking within their own.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
