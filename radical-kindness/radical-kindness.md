# Radical kindness (take 8)

When we perceive a person as *bad*, what we're really seeing is a measure of their estrangement from love. The more evil they appear, the harder this is for us to recognize. This is the ultimate tragedy: it is precisely where our love is *needed* the most that we *withhold* it the most. The result is that we create more evil while believing we are extinguishing it.

Bad behavior is a (very) cleverly disguised call for help --- often disguised even from the person's own conscious mind. The closer the person is to us, and the less bad the behavior, the easier this is for us to see. The less love we already have for them, or the worse the behavior, the more unbelievable this becomes --- until at some point we cannot believe it at all.

*All* bad behavior lies on this continuum; there is no point at which it *actually* stops being a call for help[^psychopaths]. There is only a point at which we refuse to *see* it this way.

When this happens, we violently sever contact with that tiny, remote aspect of their mind that can still be helped. Our vision turns dark as we see only darkness in them. We forsake them. If *possession by evil* were a real phenomenon, this is *exactly* what it would feel like.

We feel licensed to be cruel in order to stamp out their darkness, since they are obviously beyond help. But because of the primal need to see ourselves as *good*, we always find a way to dress this up as *righteous* or *necessary*. For the same reason, we must never even *suspect* that we are engaged in this subterfuge. Unfortunately for us, others can see our hypocrisy clearly.

It begins with behaviors like mocking and shaming. We act dismayed but feel vindicated when this unsurprisingly drives our target *further* into delusion. *Alas!*, we were right about them all along. In return, they become certain that *we* are evil. In a sense, they are correct: they are seeing the same possession in us that we saw in them. Imagine how noble they would have to be to overlook ours when we couldn't theirs. Left unchecked, this spirals into war.

Allies and bystanders may cheer us on, but subconsciously they feel empowered to be more malicious themselves --- unless they have had an awakening that allows them to recognize and "combat [evil's] powerful suggestive effect[^Jung1]." To the degree they resist being drawn in, we may no longer even recognize them as allies, making it harder for them to pull us out.

It is as though the darkness within us has reached out to ally itself with the darkness in everyone else --- friends and enemies alike --- so as to entrench itself more firmly in the world. We think we are fighting enemies but our darkness is quietly making friends. This has profound long-term consequences that far outweigh any temporary positive effects.

Upon awakening, this "dark alliance" becomes practically *palpable.* To our horror, we discover that we somehow *always knew* we were adding to the world's burden, but we could never admit it because of how shameful that would be. It was always kept just out of view, to maintain plausible deniability.

But why did we do it in the first place?

We *know* that there are dark aspects within us, and this terrifies us. It is impossible to overstate the lengths our minds will go to to keep our darkness hidden from us. The primary mechanism is to *externalize* it. This means seeking it outside, exaggerating it outside, and projecting our *own* darkness outside.

The result is a negative feedback loop: suppressing our own darkness causes us to behave darkly, which we must then suppress. The more we do this, the *less* we can see our own darkness, but the *more* others can --- which is precisely the mechanism that gives rise to evil people who are flawlessly convinced they are good. This is a powerful contempation: if it were happening to you right now, the very thing that's causing it would prevent you from seeing it. To the degree that we have not awakened, *this* is the endgame that we are forcing each other into, all the while patting ourselves on the back.

What is the solution? One way or another, you must come into direct contact with the fundamental goodness that is the very nature of your mind[^metaphysics]. There are many ways this can happen. Very sincere meditation can accomplish it, as can psychedelics. Or you might be graced with someone in your life who is willing to see the goodness deep within you even when you cannot. Whichever way it happens, it is impossible to overstate the catharsis that results.

When this happens, you simultaneously see the light in everybody else, too. You feel capable of confronting your darkness, alleviating the need to externalize it. Your heart breaks at the horrific tragedy we perpetrate on each other, and how it all ultimately stems from such a minor mistake. How did things spiral this far out of control? And more importantly, what can be done about it?

You see clearly that the most powerful thing you can personally do is to be that "someone willing to see the goodness" for everyone else. It is as though the *good* in us can now ally with the good in others, to drive out the darkness --- precisely the opposite of what we were doing before. This has profound ripple effects that are equally difficult to communicate in scientific terms.

Before awakening, the mind fears that "seeing the good" will let people off the hook or even embolden them. This fear is not entirely unwarranted: there are close analogs of compassion that are just forms of weakness. But *genuine* compassion --- the kind uncovered in awakening --- is as fierce as it needs to be. It is  possible to mock, shame, [or worse](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) with kindness --- though we must be especially on guard for self-delusion in such cases. Ultimately, employing compassion effectively requires *wisdom*, and that is certainly not gained overnight. It is the work of a lifetime, and beyond the scope of this piece.

Nonetheless, *awakening* is a critical first step. It enables us to recognize the telltale signs of "possession" and resist it --- a skill whose value is impossible to overstate. As more people are thus inoculated, the virulent cycle that perpetuates evil becomes increasingly unable to sustain itself. This is the only mechanism that can actually *undo* evil in the world, instead of merely suppressing it. And it is hard to imagine anything the world needs more right now than undoing evil.

May all beings be happy. 🙏🏽

[^psychopaths]: Though if this seems too hard to believe for psychopaths, feel free to exclude them for the purposes of this essay. 

[^Jung1]:
    > *[T]he immunity of the nation depends entirely upon the existence of a leading minority immune to the evil and capable of combating the powerful suggestive effect. ... Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.*
    
[^metaphysics]:  I apologize if this language does not jibe with your conception of reality, but there is simply no better way to put it. This is  why the advancement of metaphysics is critical. Without recognizing the primacy of consciousness, such ideas must be shoehorned into our philosophy in a way that renders them impotent.
