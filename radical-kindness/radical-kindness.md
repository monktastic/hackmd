# Radical kindness (take 9_1)

While on a months-long meditation retreat many years ago, I experienced a profound shift in perception that I think is worth sharing, regarding the nature of evil. I will describe it in mystical-sounding language. If that triggers you, please consider it poetry.

There's an aspect of your mind that already knows everything I'm about to say, though it has a *very strong* incentive not to let it into your conscious mind --- as we shall see.

---

The fundamental nature of mind is *pure Love; primordial Goodness.* It is what you most deeply *are*, and what everyone else is, too. What we perceive as *evil* is really varying degrees of *estrangement* from Love, and is better understood as *confusion.* Absolutely everyone lies on this spectrum, though some are so far gone that we find it easier to pretend that they are fundamentally different.

The more disconnected we are from this Love, the more we misperceive the world as a battle between the *equally real* forces of good and evil. *We* are obviously on the side of good, and feel licensed to fight evil in whatever way necessary --- even if that requires a little cruelty from us. It usually begins with tactics like mocking and shaming.

But because evil really *is* just "estrangement from Love," any cruelty just estranges people *further.* We act dismayed but feel vindicated when they unsurprisingly (appear to) become *more* evil. We see that we were *right* about them, which alleviates any misgivings about our behavior and licenses us to escalate. Meanwhile, they (and their allies) can plainly see that *we* are evil and must be stopped by any means necessary. In a sense, they are right: we are victims of the same confusion we see in them.

Our allies support us, but they feel inspired to be more malicious themselves. It is as though the darkness in us has reached out to ally itself with the darkness in everyone else --- friends and enemies alike --- so as to entrench itself deeper in the world. This has profound ripple effects that far outweigh any temporary apparent benefits of our cruelty.

If left unchecked, the inevitable result of this mutual escalation is war. We don't *want* war, but starved of contact with *genuine Goodness*, we can't help but be addicted to the next best thing: the delicious *self-righteousness* that this whole ludicrous game provides. We have a primal need to know ourselves as good, but our dualistic paradigm only lets us understand *good* by contrast with *evil*. Therefore we secretly *need* to ensure that darkness survives.

Of course, this whole game is played at a subconscious level. Our mind would never let us suspect --- let alone admit --- that we're doing this, because that would threaten our self-image as *good people.* This means that the more deeply we are caught in this confusion, the more confident we become that we're not. Anyone who even *suggests* it risks becoming an enemy. Why are they focused on *us* when there's *real* evil out there? In this way, a person or group[^politics] caught in this trap tragically seals itself off from the one thing it desires the most: genuine Goodness.

The only way to reverse this process is to somehow reconnect with that Goodness. This can happen in varying degrees through meditation, psychedelics, or even just a chance meeting with someone willing to see the good within us at a critical moment when others (and even *we*) cannot. When we make *full* contact with this Love, it is impossible to overstate the catharsis that results.

Suddenly our eyes are opened to the destruction we've been perpetrating in the name of good. We discover that we've *always* known that we were doing this, but somehow hid it from ourselves. We see that everyone else is caught in exactly the same trap, and that we were never any better than them. It is a heartbreaking tragedy of epic proportions: it is precisely where love is needed the most that we withhold it the most. Our innocent desire to know ourselves as good has resulted in so much bad.

We vow to recognize when others are secretly calling for help in the form of "evil" --- and discover this happening in *infinitely more places and ways* than we could have ever imagined, let alone believed. We may not always have the energy to respond to such calls, or the wisdom to know how to, but we now know how not to get ensnared by the darkness like before. It is as though the *light* within us is able to ally itself with the light in others, to jointly drive out darkness. This, too, has profound ripple effects.

Our "enemies" can subconsciously perceive this shift in us. They can sense that we are trustworthy in a way that we very much weren't before; in a way that not even their allies are, given how blinded they are by *the cause*. They sense that we are a step in the direction back to the Wholeness they crave --- which is the only real way anyone "becomes good." Dialogue becomes possible. Deep traumas have a safe channel to be released.

Before such an awakening, we fear that compassion is sometimes the wrong response; that it will be used against us. This fear is not entirely unwarranted: the mind's distorted version of Love is a weak simulacrum of the real thing; a vague warm-and-fuzzy feeling that seeks to avoid conflict and *does* run that risk. But genuine Love has the power of a thousand blazing suns, and can manifest as absolutely anything; from a gentle smile, to mockery and shaming, or [worse](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), as the situation warrants. We now see that it is *always* the right motivation, if only we learn to harness it wisely.

This doesn't mean we are out of the woods. It is all too easy to fall back into our old habits. The mind is infinitely tricky, making it surprisingly difficult to detect when we've fallen out of compassion and back into its close analog, *self-righteousness.* This is especially true given that (approximately) the same behavior can be manifested through either channel. And being "awakened" in this sense isn't binary. It's a process that slowly saturates our being. But at least now we recognize the telltale signs of being seduced by darkness[^utah], giving us some ability to resist it.

As more people are thus inoculated, the virulent cycle that perpetuates evil becomes increasingly unable to sustain itself. This is the only mechanism that can actually *undo* evil in the world, instead of merely suppressing it. And it is hard to imagine anything the world needs more right now than that.

May all beings be happy. 🙏🏽

### On awakening through psychedelics

From an online web forum (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
> 
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

From a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA (emphasis mine):

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

### The shadow and projection

> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing. Until we make deep peace with such aspects of ourselves, unwanted aspects we don’t want to see, by learning to receive a love that touches in past them to the intrinsic goodness of our being, we can’t open to the intrinsic goodness of others that also lies hidden from our view.*
>
> *We need to receive love from those who have sent it to us just as we are, with all our flaws, in order to relax into the deeper goodness within us that always deserves such love and to heal there. Then we can offer a love in turn that embraces others with similar flaws, that touches in on their intrinsic worth, mirrors their goodness back at them, and doesn’t give up on them no matter what.*

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* --- Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* --- Carl Jung


> *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago


[^politics]: This is what is happening with politics in the US (and presumably elsewhere) today.

[^utah]: This quote may help you sense what I am talking about. Don't focus on whether it is *true* or not, but on how it makes you *feel*:

    > *"The earth is not dying, it is being killed. And those that are killing it have names and addresses."* --- Utah Phillips
    
    The feeling you're looking for is something like this: "yay, we found the evil, and now all we have to do is *smash* it!"
