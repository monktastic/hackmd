> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

We've all had the experience of doing something that we know to be wrong while pretending that it's not. It is this same self-deceptive tendency that is at the heart of _all_ forms of evil. Freed of it, the mind is naturally peaceful and has no desire to cause any harm. This profound truth is relatively easier to see in ourselves, but much harder to see in others.

> _We judge ourselves by our intentions, and others by their actions_ --- Stephen Covey, paraphrasing the Fundamental Attribution Error

It is hard for an astonishing reason: deep down, we _know_ that darkness still lives within us, and we must do everything we can to hide this fact from ourselves.

The kindest and wisest people you know are never contemptful or self-righteous. Why not? Because they've seen clearly that those emotions exist only to support this sham. They have no other function.

When you find yourself wishing harm on bad people, that's your own darkness hoping to further extinguish whatever little light may still be left within them --- and it usually works. It gives birth to _more_ evil, both in you and them. By reinforcing the darkness _out there_ (and calling it righteous), you draw attention away from the darkness _in here_. Wise people have seen through this most profound of self-deceptions.

It's been said that forgiveness isn't for the other person so much as for yourself. The same goes for the advice to be kind at all times. It's not a trick to condone evil, and it's not about being nice: kindness can be as fierce, wrathful, or even violent as the situation requires. But you _really_ don't want to wake up one day to discover that you've been a profound hypocrite.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

> I saw the lies and self-deception I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it.
>
> I [felt] the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them. At the same time I also saw that they have their own lies and self-deceptions.
>
> The result was that I felt like a failure as a person. I wasn’t the person I had thought I was. It was humiliating. I felt really dreadful and it was completely humbling.
>
> The judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source. But then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.
>
> The entire experience gave me a second chance to live a more meaningful life. I felt I had a chance now to change things so that the next time I get back to the life review it wouldn’t be the same or at least they would say, “He tried.”
