# Radical kindness and the nature of evil

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- Author unknown

While on meditation retreat many years ago, I realized something shocking about the nature of evil. Many of you will already realize all this, but I feel compelled to share anyway.

There are two aspects to your mind: a light and a dark. The light aspect seeks only to bring more light to the world, while the darkness thrives on _darkening the world and getting away with it_.

The light aspect is much deeper and more fundamental; it is much closer to what you truly _are_. It knows perfectly well that it is impossible to brighten the world through unkindness. Therefore, the only way the darkness can operate is by convincing you that it is, in some twisted way, actually _good_. The way it does this is _insanely clever_.

First, it allocates some percentage of the population as _deserving_ of your compassion, and therefore off-limits to its operation: the "good people," the victims, etc. In fact, it even makes a grand display of being overtly nice to them. This is how it wins your trust and brings down your guard.

Then it identifies the people who _don't_ deserve your compassion: the bad people of the world; the perpetrators. When you think about such people, your instinct is to feel contempt and malice --- and then to justify why these are actually _righteous_. You're only *fighting evil*, after all. But far from your darkness _fighting_ theirs, the two are secretly _allied_. In fact, it is more like two tentacles of the same shadowy organism, embedding itself more firmly in each mind, so as to increase its stranglehold on this world.

I can't convince you of this; it's something you must see for yourself. But notice how _good_ it feels when we maliciously mock our enemies and they indignantly dig in their heels and double down on their idiocy. We may _pretend_ to be dismayed, but this is the reaction we secretly _hoped_ for: it proves that we were _right_ about them, and that our contempt was therefore justified. If our behavior pushes them further into the dark, well, that's on _them_. They deserve it anyway.

But everyone can see perfectly well that you are possessed by darkness. Your "allies" won't consciously acknowledge it, of course, because _their_ darkness is operating _in tandem_ with yours. Meanwhile, your enemies will increasingly perceive _you_ as evil, proving that they were right about you. After all, what kind of person _knowingly_ darkens the world while pretending that it's good?

On one hand, they are wrong: you _don't_ realize that this is what you're doing. If you did, you would immediately put a stop to it --- not because you're one of the special "good people," but because _that's just how minds work_. Even people who are so far gone that they are _self-admittedly_ evil can only be that way under the sway of a clever possession --- one that's _infinitely more clever_ than the one you are presently up against, though of the same basic nature. You should be _immensely grateful_ that yours is relatively tame (though you are _still_ losing to it, somehow).

On the other hand, the light in you _does_ know very clearly that you're doing this --- and it's not exactly unconscious. One day --- perhaps under the guidance of psychedelic medicines, or maybe on your deathbed if you're unlucky --- you will discover, with a shock, that this knowledge was _always_ consciously accessible, even as you were pretending not to hear its quiet entreaties. You will realize, to your abject horror, that you were in some sense _knowingly_ participating in the "dark alliance." In this sense, you were as complicit as anyone.

You will wonder why nobody was kind enough to point this out to you. If you'd known, you surely would have stopped! And then you'll realize: they _did_ tell you. Your enemies were _constantly_ telling you what a hypocrite you were, but you didn't listen. You _couldn't_ listen, because they were being such jerks about it. Why couldn't they see that this behavior just pushed you further into the dark?

You will recall the people in your life who held your light for you even when you couldn't hold it for yourself. These were your _true_ allies --- even if some of them held beliefs you were _sure_ were wrong. They were the ones who reminded you that ultimately, you don't ever _want_ to be evil --- even though sometimes it sure as hell appeared otherwise. And you will realize, to your dismay, that you could have _been_ that ally for countless other people. That it was actually the _worst_ people who deserved your compassion the most; where you had the most opportunity to be of service.

Compassion has nothing to do with being _nice_: that's just a lie that the darkness tells you, so that you won't even _consider_ it when dealing with "bad people." It can actually be as fierce --- or perhaps even *violent* --- as the situation warrants. Even _mockery_ can be done with compassion. It's impossible to say what compassion (or love, or kindness --- these are all synonyms) _looks like_, because it doesn't have to look like anything in particular. And yet you will know very clearly when it is operating in you. In fact, you already _do_, if you listen carefully enough.

There will still be times when another person's darkness is too powerful for you to respond with love; where it is better to simply protect yourself by whatever means necessary. And yet you will know how not to get triggered by their evil and thereby drawn back into the _dark alliance._ You will see, clearly, that adding your darkness to the world can _never_ make it better.

About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
