# Radical kindness (take 6)

###### tags: `kindness`

While on a months-long meditation retreat many years ago, I experienced a profound shift in perception that I think is worth sharing, regarding the nature of evil. It's very hard to justify on scientific grounds, but if you introspect carefully you may recognize the truth in it.

People are intrinsically good, but *profoundly* confused. This confusion appears externally as *evil*. Every time we see evil behavior, we have a choice to make: to recognize it as confusion, or to see "badness" as inherent to the person. This choice has tremendous consequences. Because we do not recognize the gravity of this choice, and because it is often hard to recognize bad behavior as merely confused, we frequently default to the "lazy" option of seeing people as bad. This has the unfortunate result of creating *more* evil. The result of eight billion people doing this is a world full of evil without any insight into how we created it.

Let me unpack that before I take the story deeper.

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- [Author unknown](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/)

If you could glimpse the entire web of conditions that led to a person's bad behavior --- [epigenetic](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics), genetic, environmental, developmental, incidental, etc. --- your heart would **always** overflow with compassion. The illusion of a "bad person" cackling behind the scenes would be utterly dispelled as you glimpsed the horrors of their particular "great battle." This doesn't mean that you would tolerate their behavior, as we shall soon see.

When you choose to treat a person with ridicule, contempt, or hatred, there is no interest in seeing them freed from their confusion, and on the contrary, generally pleasure in seeing them pushed further in. Think about a time you mocked someone for their harmful beliefs. Don't you get a delicious hit of self-righteousness when they (predictably) just double down on their idiocy? This just adds to their web of delusion, which inevitably leads to *more* bad behavior somewhere down the line. Meanwhile, our allies feel more empowered to be more malicious themselves.

The "flash of insight" that I cannot prove (but that you may intuitively suspect) is this: whether you plant the seeds of compassion or malice in that moment determines the eventual impact of your words and behaviors. You can *mock* with love or malice. You can even [*shoot someone* with love](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) or malice. But the ultimate impact of your actions will largely be determined by which intention you apply. People --- friends, enemies, and bystanders alike --- are *extremely* sensitive to our motives, and are deeply influenced by them, consciously or not. This has profound ripple effects that long outlive any immediate physical effects.

In other words, the decision to *see* evil --- as something real, intrinsic, and worthy of contempt; as opposed to being profound confusion that must be healed by whatever means necessary --- actually *creates* evil. And the opposite choice actually *undoes* it, even though the effect is often not immediately obvious.

> *Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.* ― Martin Luther King, Jr.

Now to go deeper.

I realized in that moment that I *always knew* that my behavior was creating more evil. Yet I somehow always found a clever way to justify it to my conscious mind as *good* and *righteous*. In this way, I kept myself blind to what I was doing.

> *Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply.* ― Reinhold Niebuhr

> *The road to hell is paved with good intentions.* --- Proverb

I simultaneously saw it operating powerfully in everybody else, too. The question is, *why* would we behave this way?

Ironically, I did it because of the primal need to see myself as *good*. Subconsciously I knew that dark aspects existed within me, and this threatened that self-image. The easiest way to resolve this tension was to convince my conscious mind that evil existed only *out there*. So not only was I eager to *find* it out there, I would often project my *own* darkness outside, and even *increase* the darkness whenever socially acceptable (as it so often is). That is, I didn't do it *despite* the darkness it created; I subconsciously did it *because of it.*

When large groups of people team up to do this together, at some level they are *knowingly* entrenching the darkness on the "other side," so as to maintain a positive collective self-image. The other side, of course, does this right back at us, which only proves that we were right. We refuse to see just how much we contributed. The horrific irony is that *none of us* is ultimately bad, and yet so much suffering is generated from this innocent desire to recognize ourselves as *good* --- which we actually are.

The hardest part about communicating this realization is that the same mechanism that causes us to do it and to hide it from ourselves also powerfully prevents us from recognizing it even when pointed out. Especially when one has been hurt by another person or group, being asked to see the good in them --- let alone reflect on one's own complicity --- may sound heartless; even dangerously close to victim blaming. On the other hand, if what I'm saying is true, then *not* doing this is certain to lead to even *more* suffering for oneself and others. This is a dreadful dilemma. Luckily, there is a beautiful solution.

By perceiving clearly how one's victimizer is *possessed* by evil --- as opposed to *fundamentally* evil --- and thus themselves a victim of the *very same* evil that is victimizing you, one discovers a surprising way to "eat one's cake and have it, too." That is, to have the satisfaction of destroying one's oppressor --- now recognized as *evil itself* --- without creating more suffering for oneself and others. Like a skilled surgeon carefully targeting only the cancerous cells, it is possible to excise evil without causing more harm. But for this to work, there is a crucial prerequisite: self-knowledge.

The Buddhists believe that the very nature of consciousness is *intrinsic goodness;* that this is what you most fundamentally *are.* Learning to perceive this directly does several things. It alleviates the mistaken need to see ourselves as good by *comparison*. It enables us to see the same goodness in others, and to perceive their darkness as extrinsic. It empowers us to confront our own shadows, which in turn alleviates the need to project them outward. Perhaps most powerfully, it brings down our defenses, enabling us to see clearly how we have been active participants in this madness --- and crucially, graces us with the self-compassion to see that it's *not our fault.*

Our hearts are overwhelmed as we perceive the whole world trapped in the same horrific delusion that we ourselves are slowly emerging from, and the immense and needless suffering it causes. We see others as ourselves, and vow to only ever help them *out* of their confusion, by connecting with their basic goodness --- even if our outward behavior must sometimes take the form of mockery (or worse). We must still develop the wisdom to harness that compassion effectively, but now we have the motivation to do so.

I wish I could say I became a saint after this  realization, but far from it. I still have a *lot* of work to do. But I'm grateful to know that the problem is tractable, and that humanity is (re)discovering methods to address it.

May all beings be happy. 🙏🏽

### Selected quotes


> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing. Until we make deep peace with such aspects of ourselves, unwanted aspects we don’t want to see, by learning to receive a love that touches in past them to the intrinsic goodness of our being, we can’t open to the intrinsic goodness of others that also lies hidden from our view.*
>
> *We need to receive love from those who have sent it to us just as we are, with all our flaws, in order to relax into the deeper goodness within us that always deserves such love and to heal there. Then we can offer a love in turn that embraces others with similar flaws, that touches in on their intrinsic worth, mirrors their goodness back at them, and doesn’t give up on them no matter what.*

From an online web forum (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

From a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA (emphasis mine):

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* --- Carl Jung

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung

> *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.*
