> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

We've all had the experience of doing something that we know to be wrong while pretending that it's not. If you were to inspect your mind carefully enough in that moment, you would discover the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_.

Part of you knows that what you're doing is wrong --- and doesn't really want to be doing it --- while another part is carefully pretending _not_ to know. All forms of misbehavior ultimately stem from this capacity for self-deception. You excuse yourself easily, because deep down you know that you're a good person; the bad parts feel somehow extrinsic and forgivable.

This is actually true --- not just of you, but of everyone. Though I cannot convince you of this, a deep aspect of your mind can perceive it directly. At the conscious level, however, you sometimes choose not to. Instead, it seems like some people's misbehavior could only be caused by a fundamental flaw in their very being. This is a misperception. Its source is surprising, and its effects are disastrous.

> _We judge ourselves by our intentions, and others by their actions_ --- Stephen Covey, paraphrasing the [Fundamental Attribution Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error)

Part of you knows that darkness exists in you, and this threatens your self-image as a _good person._ Instead of confronting your own darkness, you find a clever way to hide from it: you scan for the darkness in others, so that you may attack them. This way you are _fighting evil_, which proves that you're good.

The problem is that part of you can always perceive the kernel of good in others, no matter how buried or remote it is. This part of you knows perfectly well that being unkind can only ever push them _deeper_ into whatever delusion is causing their misbehavior in the first place; _further_ from any possibility of expressing their goodness. We enjoy being cruel to bad people not because of the good it does, but for precisely the opposite reason: it gives our darkness the perfect cover to satisfy its sinister urges without threatening our self-image. This is every bit as dark as it sounds: part of you is trying to extinguish light from this world and get away with it --- and it just found an ideal victim; someone that no sane person would dare object to.

Your target's subconscious can perceive this clearly --- which means that they cannot help but see _you_ as evil. Whatever their past sins, this enables them to view themselves as the righteous one in this interaction, and compels them to be cruel in return. They are only _fighting evil_, after all. But _you_ know that _you're_ the good guy, and so this behavior only further convinces you that they really _are_ fundamentally bad --- which licenses you to escalate _your_ righteous cruelty.

Both your mind and theirs (as well as those of onlookers) are made darker as a result. And while your mind tells you that this is merely an unfortunate side-effect of well-intentioned behavior, this is a lie: the whole game was actually orchestrated by the darkness in both of your minds. Far from your evil _fighting_ theirs, the two are secretly allied, in a devious bid to create more.

Part of you knows that they were _right_ when they saw evil in your eye --- exactly the thing you are accusing them of --- but you must never admit this to yourself. You instead wonder why they don't take this as a precious opportunity to introspect and self-correct. That's what any fundamentally decent person would do, after all. But this is profoundly hypocritical: part of you knows that you yourself are not remotely capable of responding graciously to the kind of malice you just directed at them. Given your low opinion of them, how could _they_ possibly be? You _knew_ they weren't, which means you also knew how this would all play out.

If you introspect carefully enough, you will discover a horrifying sense in which this whole thing was _intended_ to make the world darker. This is the secret trick that evil uses to propagate itself.

> _Ultimately evil is done not so much by evil people, but by good people who do not know themselves and who do not probe deeply._ ― Reinhold Niebuhr (author of the serenity prayer)

You know that literary trope where all the horrors of the world can be traced back to a secret conspiracy that is hidden in plain sight, and yet, maddeningly, which nobody can see? Well, _this is it._ I am not just sharing an interesting theory; I am pointing at something that you can discover concretely in yourself. No twist ending in any fictional story could ever gobsmack you as hard as the first time you discover that part of your own mind has always been in on the "evil global conspiracy." Part of you already knows that you're doing this, but another part is carefully hiding it from conscious reflection --- again, the very self-deception we love to skewer others for. We do this to draw attention away from what lurks inside.

To be clear, you don't do this because you're bad. That conclusion would just cause you to bring the same ugly fight to yourself (or to me, for daring accuse you of it). You're also not a "good person," to be contrasted with all those "bad people." Nor am I better than you. We're just _human_, and this is how we work. The deepest part of us just wants things to be okay; the rest is just horrifically misguided attempts to get us there.

If you actually want to fix the evil in others, you have to heal them of their capacity for self-deception. This is only possible to the degree that you are free of your own. Otherwise, your every action will be imbued with a sanctimony that only makes it _harder_ for others to confront this most painful truth in themselves. This only serves to reinforce the very conditions that your mind tells you it is so honorably fighting --- and makes it harder for you to detect the part of you that is doing this _on purpose._

At the very deepest level, you've never wanted to harm anyone --- and it is entirely possible to fight evil from this place. In fact, it is the _only_ place from which evil can be legitimately fought. You are not fighting the _person_, but their self-deception. The internal feeling is, paradoxically, one of _blinding love_. As corny as this sounds, it is the one thing that evil cannot endure. It gives it absolutely nothing to latch onto; nothing to feed on; no way to justify its own existence via your hypocrisy. This makes it die a little (or a lot) inside, and signals to their "good side" --- however buried or remote --- that it is safe to come out. Despite your surface differences (which may still be great), this deepest aspect of their mind slowly begins to identify you as an ally in the larger fight against _evil as a principle_ --- the only fight that ultimately matters. All of this happens subconsciously at first.

This is true kindness. To be perfectly clear: it is not about being _nice_. Kindness can be as fierce, wrathful, or perhaps even [violent](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) as the situation warrants. But one thing it never is, is self-righteous. This shift in motivation makes all the difference in the world, and it becomes possible to perceive this directly. When enough people do this, I believe it produces something like "herd immunity" against evil. This is the condition we ought to be aiming for.

> _Such a [person] knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day._ — Carl Jung

It's been said that forgiveness isn't for the other person so much as for yourself. The same is true of kindness. The exhortations to be kind to "bad people" are not a trick to justify weakness or condone evil, but precisely the opposite. It is ultimately the _only_ path toward the world you long for. You owe it to yourself to discover just how fiercely powerful your love --- the "real you" --- can be in getting us there.

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
