# Radical kindness (take 5)

###### tags: `kindness`

People have a tendency to imagine that the reason for the sorry state of the world is a handful of *bad people* off somewhere doing *bad things*. Other times, our blame extends to all the common people who support them. In our more charitable moments, we admit that we might have a small part to play, but our hand is forced by circumstances.

All of these have some truth, but there's a *much bigger* issue that escapes our notice. I'll try to point it out, but it's not easy. There's a powerful *reason* that it escapes our notice.

Try to feel what the following quote is hinting at:

> *Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle.* --- [Author unknown](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/)

Most of us instinctively understand the profound truth underlying this message and agree --- in general. But when it comes to *specific cases*, we often convince ourselves that it doesn't apply. It just seems *so obvious* to us that *this person* isn't misbehaving due to any "great battle," but because they're just *bad*. Take a moment and reflect how often that feels true. Moreover, even when it *is* due to a great battle, sometimes we feel that kindness would be naïve.

There are three big mistakes here.

First, if you could perceive the entire web of conditions that led to a person's behavior --- [epigenetic](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190326-what-is-epigenetics), genetic, environmental, developmental, incidental, and usually a complex combination of all of the above --- your heart would *always* overflow with compassion as you grasped the terrible intricacies of their particular "great battle." The illusion of a "bad person" cackling behind the scenes would be utterly dispelled. You would directly perceive that people are *hopelessly lost* within the maze of their minds, and sometimes do frightfully stupid (and harmful) things in hopes of finding their way out.

Second, "kind" does not mean "nice." It does not mean that you *excuse* anything. It's simply the opposite of *malicious*; the heartfelt intention to make things *better* and not *worse*. In this way, it is *never* the wrong motivation. It does not prescribe (or preclude) any particular course of action. [Sometimes the kindest action is to shoot someone](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/).

The third is hardest to see. Any time you choose to overlook a person's fundamental goodness, and treat them with ridicule, contempt, or hatred, you are secretly taking pleasure in their profound confusion. There is no interest in seeing them freed from it, and on the contrary, often a desire to see them pushed further in. This is malicious, so to hide it from ourselves, our conscious minds dress it up with all sorts of clever justifications about why it's good or necessary.

*We're* not bad people either, so why do we do this? Ironically, it comes from a primal need to see ourselves as *good*. A very effective way to maintain that self-perception is to project our own darkness outward, to make it clear that evil only exists *out there.* It's not that there *isn't* darkness out there, but we are subconsciously motivated to magnify it, and even *increase* it where permissible. And how better to make it permisslbe than to convince ourselves (and our allies) that it's good and just and necessary? We know perfectly well that this will only lead to retaliation, but we *need* the presence of "bad guys," to remind us that *we* are good.

Frustratingly, the very mechanism that *causes* us to do this makes us resistant to *seeing* that we are doing this, or how harmful it is. That is, the need to see ourselves as good powerfully prevents us from acknowledging our own malicious behavior. We only see *others* doing it --- those hypocrites! All of *our* examples are justified: here's *proof!* The cumulative effect of *billions* of people doing this (while convinced we're not) is a world of horrific suffering, where nobody can quite pin down where the problem lies. Or rather, *everybody* can pin it down, but somehow it's always "out there." Get a large enough group of people to agree on who "the problem" is, and I think you know what happens next.

If you are thinking "good thing I don't do that" but are still curious whether *this may be the very defense mechanism he's talking about*, the most effective way I know to find out is to *deeply forgive yourself.* This may seem counterintuitive: if you're already convinced of your goodness, what could there be to forgive? But if you're patient enough, you may discover aspects of yourself that you are not yet ready to confront. *These* are the hidden aspects that we continue to project outward until we are ready to be healed. I don't know if it helps to hear this from an internet stranger, but: *you deserve it.* I can't see your "great battle," but I can tell you with mathematical precision: *it's not your fault.*

As we heal, we may still discover cases where mocking (or even shooting!) someone is the wisest response. But when we do so, it will be with genuine *love* in the heart. We will recognize others as ourselves, and thus deserving of the same grace that somehow pulled our sorry asses out of the darkness. And we will find, astonishingly, that this makes all the difference in the world.

### Selected quotes

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* --- Carl Jung

---

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

---

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung

From an online web forum (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

From a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA (emphasis mine):

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

> *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago

---

> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing. Until we make deep peace with such aspects of ourselves, unwanted aspects we don’t want to see, by learning to receive a love that touches in past them to the intrinsic goodness of our being, we can’t open to the intrinsic goodness of others that also lies hidden from our view.*
>
> *We need to receive love from those who have sent it to us just as we are, with all our flaws, in order to relax into the deeper goodness within us that always deserves such love and to heal there. Then we can offer a love in turn that embraces others with similar flaws, that touches in on their intrinsic worth, mirrors their goodness back at them, and doesn’t give up on them no matter what.*

> *Nobody is immune to a nationwide evil unless he is unshakably convinced of the danger of his own character being tainted by the same evil. But the immunity of the nation depends entirely upon the existence of a leading minority immune to the evil and capable of combating the powerful suggestive effect.*
> ...
> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.*
