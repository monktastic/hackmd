# Radical kindness

> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle..._ --- (Source unknown)

If you were to inspect the very deepest layers of your mind, you would find that at your core is _pure Light_.

When you are close to your Light, you naturally behave in ways that brighten the world. You find creative ways to reunite others with _their_ Light. When dealing with evil, you are better able to perceive the countless causes and conditions that brought it into being, and find clever ways to heal or counteract them. You are able to do this without a trace of malice. Your methods don't necessarily _look_ anything like love or kindness as we commonly understand them, but that's what they actually are --- and you know this clearly.

As you drift away from your Light, something quite different begins to happen: you start trying to _separate_ others from their Light. If this sounds _evil_ and like something you would never do, that's great: it's the first step in realizing just how insidious the process is.

It begins with the darkness impersonating your Light. It knows what you consider right and wrong, and it divides the world neatly into _those who have been wronged_ (the victims) and _those who are doing wrong_ (the perpetrators). It then makes a big display of being _really nice_ to the former and _really cruel_ to the latter. This way, it's totally clear that you're one of the _good guys_. But it has a secret agenda. Unlike the Light --- which uses wisdom and insight to eliminate evil --- it leverages contempt and malice to covertly create _more_ of it.

Part of you knows _perfectly well_ that treating people with contempt only pushes them further into the dark --- along with everyone who witnesses your unkindness, as well as yourself. This only makes the world darker, and not by accident: it's the entire mission of your darkness. Some part of you knows this clearly, yet you will find yourself curiously unable to consciously admit it. Instead, your mind will conjure up a compelling story about how your behavior is somehow a net good; how you are only _fighting evil._ Your nominal "allies" will support this story to the degree that _their_ darkness is operating, creating a sealed bubble of internal validation.

Make no mistake: this behavior is evil, and the deepest part of you knows this. You wouldn't be doing it unless you were profoundly frustrated and felt you had no other choice. You don't really want to be unkind, and if the world were a brighter place, you wouldn't have to. It's a horrible plight, and you deserve compassion for it, not judgement. But that's hard to come by in our world. Your enemies just instigate your darkness, and your "allies" also encourage it. This predicament creates cognitive dissonance. You really _are_ a good person, but your behavior is _evil_. Not by anyone else's standards, but by your own --- _if_ you were to inspect your mind carefully enough. And this is the trick the darkness uses to hide itself: by producing a compelling enough cover story, it ensures that you never _do_ inspect your mind carefully enough.

If someone were to self-righteously call you out for this evil behavior --- and moreover, hypocrisy, since everyone can see that you know, even as you vigorously pretend not to --- you wouldn't sagely reflect on their advice and thank them for it. Your darkness would instantly frame them as an enemy --- even though they are right according to your _own_ deepest judgement. Such interactions just give your darkness new justification (and motivation) to express more of itself in the future --- which is exactly what it wants.

Part of you can sense that such a person doesn't have your best interest at heart. Actually, they don't have _anyone's_ best interest at heart in that moment, despite what their story says. They are under the sway of their _own_ darkness: they are knowingly pushing you further in while trying to get away with it --- which they will, because society agrees that "bad people" deserve only malice. Although they may nominally be your enemy, their darkness is actually _allied_ with yours, like two tentacles of the same shadowy organism, entrenching itself more firmly in the world.

Round and round this process goes, with each person's darkness triggering and reinforcing (almost) everyone else's, with everyone totally confident that they're being _righteous_, oblivious to the harm they're actually causing. This is the insanely clever trick the darkness uses to spread itself.

> _He who fights with monsters should take care lest he thereby become a monster._
>  --- Nietzsche

Yet some people seem to have the remarkable ability to steer clear of this fiendish trap. When confronted with your darkness, instead of it triggering theirs, it somehow activates their Light. This encourages you to confront your own dishonesty in a way that isn't threatening. They may accomplish this through a variety of means that may be gentle or fierce, depending on the circumstances. But even when their behavior is profoundly antagonistic to your stated beliefs and aims, part of you can sense that they are somehow allied with your Light.

Though it may not always look like it on the surface, this is true kindness. It is as though you are being inoculated from the darkness --- and if you manage to stay healthy, you will contribute to _herd immunity_ from it. To the degree we achieve this as a society, we will be able to hash out our differences in a healthy and productive way. Until then, deadlock or war are the only possible outcomes.

We each have the capacity to drift disturbingly far into the dark before realizing that it has ensnared us. We are unlikely to notice it by ourselves (or with the help of our "allies"), because the further into the dark we go, the stronger its distortion field; the more flawlessly we are convinced that we're _right_, and that our ends justify any means. We find ourselves increasingly focused on our _ideas_ on how to fix the world, and drifting further from the one thing that actually has this capability: our Light. The more this happens, the exponentially greater the skill and wisdom needed to pull us out, and the more we resist _being_ pulled out --- and yet the greater our relief and gratitude when someone (or something) finally does.

Evil really is a problem, and it certainly won't be solved by our being _nice._ Sometimes unconventional methods like shame or even [violence](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/) are indeed necessary. These could be called _radical kindness_. But unless you have become exquisitely sensitive to (and honest with yourself about) whether you are operating from your darkness or your Light, you will only be unwittingly creating _more_ evil through such methods, even as you're utterly convinced of your own good. If there is even a _trace_ of self-righteousness, or any enjoyment from being unkind, your darkness is still in charge, leaking out in countless ways that continually escape your notice. Despite your consciously-stated intentions, your behavior will secretly telegraph to allies and enemies alike that _confronting my darkness is scary; let us hide from the Light together._ It is impossible to overstate just how insidious this trap is. It must be seen to be believed.

One method to see it is the use of entheogenic medicines in the appropriate setting. If all goes well, you will be forcefully confronted with what a profound hypocrite you've been. You will see that everything you harshly judge others for is present, in some way or another, somewhere within your own mind. In fact the darkness "out there" is, in a peculiar sense, actually a _projection_ of the darkness "in here."

You will find that reason you so voraciously seek out the darkness in others is to help you avoid noticing and dealing with your _own_ --- and that only by healing your own can you gain genuine insight into how to effectively deal with theirs. You perceive the very mechanism by which contempt and self-righteousness birth new evil, and how your kindness heals it. You are shown every single instance in which you've done both, and how they've manifested in the world in ways you could never have fathomed from your simplistic model of reality. It becomes crystal clear that one of these paths leads to "heaven," and the other, "hell." Not just for you, but for _all_ of us.

If this all sounds hard to believe, well, it gets weirder. I want to share a section of a [poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem/) by beloved and recently deceased Zen master Thích Nhất Hạnh (which I recommend reading in its entirety):

> _I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,  
> my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.  
> And I am the arms merchant,  
> selling deadly weapons to Uganda._
>
> _I am the twelve-year-old girl,  
> refugee on a small boat,  
> who throws herself into the ocean  
> after being raped by a sea pirate.  
> And I am the pirate,  
> my heart not yet capable  
> of seeing and loving._
>
> _I am a member of the politburo,  
> with plenty of power in my hands.  
> And I am the man who has to pay  
> his “debt of blood” to my people  
> dying slowly in a forced-labor camp._

Chilling --- but just a poem, right? Here's Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is _sooooo_ much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.

"Absolutely literally," he says! There's a very good reason that stories like Andy Weir's phenomenal [The Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) tickle our funny bones. Some part of you _knows_ that they are true, even if you can't yet pin down exactly how.

This isn't just a New-Age philosophy designed to make us all get along. The closer you are to your Light, the more you perceive all of this directly. Reality is one indivisible whole, and _you are That_. From this vantage point, the exhortation "always be kind" is as obvious and unnecessary as "don't punch the mirror." Of _course_ it's going to punch back, just as hard. Your primal urge to forsake and excise the "evil people" is an outward manifestation of your desire to disown the dark parts of yourself. It is _tremendous_ folly[^Equalizer]. The harder you try, the more they grow. It feels risky to tell you that the reason that your nemeses are so incorrigible; the very cause for their existence, is the _way_ you fight them. But it is the astonishing truth, and it can be known directly.

The admonition to be kind to "bad people" is not a pious trick to calm your righteous anger. Kindness can be as wrathful as needed. To the degree that you can perceive others as yourself, this wrath will be imbued with insight into how to pull them --- all of us, really --- back toward the Light. Otherwise, it only pushes them / you / us further from it. Kindness and cruelty are never truly aimed at just one person; they are only ever directed at the Whole. When you see this, _of course_ kindness is always the right answer. The alternative is _insane_. The dividing line between "people who deserve my compassion" and "people who don't" is seen to have existed only in your mind, and only as a tool to help your darkness operate with impunity. Now you want nothing to do with such madness.

I may say all this with authority, but in truth I have a long way to go to be reunited with my Light. But hard as it may be, I've seen clearly that it is the only way to truly be of service, and therefore the only worthwhile goal. Everything else is a clever distraction. I'm sure I'll stumble repeatedly on my way there, and I hope you'll be there to offer your own kindness when I do --- whether you're _nice_ about it or not.

[^Equalizer]: This is the problem with revenge fantasy flicks like _The Equalizer_ or _Shooter_, and also why they are so popular. The "bad guys" are so obviously and one-dimensionally evil that they couldn't _possibly_ deserve any kindness. Although it's fiction, our darkness uses it as evidence that compassion is sometimes wrong. Watch your mind carefully during these movies, and you can see this process in action. And we _celebrate_ it.

I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine.
