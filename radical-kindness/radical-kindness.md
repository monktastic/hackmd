Being kind matters. Everyone knows that. But it matters *especially* when dealing with "bad people" --- and I think that's an important lesson that society hasn't learned yet.

It's easy to understand why we should be kind to victims. It's much harder to see why we should be kind to perpetrators. Intuitively, we feel that this would just empower them. But this mistaken intuition comes from a profound misunderstanding of what kindness *is*.

Kind is not the same as *nice* --- which is merely about being pleasant or agreeable, without regard to outcome. One can be kind without being nice (e.g., tough love), and nice without being kind (sometimes called "idiot compassion," of which *enabling* is one example). Instead, we might define kindness as the opposite of malice: the intention to be of benefit in the world, whatever form that might take. In this sense, it is never the wrong attitude. It does not preclude any particular course of action.

Genuine kindness stems from a sort of radical honesty. It requires recognizing and admitting a deeply uncomfortable truth: that the darkness I see in the world lives within me, too. This truth is so uncomfortable that we push it out of our conscious minds, and recoil at its mere suggestion. It takes significant inner work to feel safe enough to allow it back into our consciousness, where it can be processed properly.

What is it like to be confronted with this realization? The following quote from an online forum captures the experience well (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

To the degree that one has had this revelation, one's entire outlook on "good" and "bad" is profoundly transformed. This transformation is captured well in the following quote, this time by a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA:

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way… a white screen with some dark spots.***

We see that this is not only true of *us*, but of *everyone*. This, in turn, radically alters how we interact with the world. Instead of seeing ourselves as "good people" valiantly trying to defeat the bad, we discover a much more subtle and profound strategy: it is as though the fundamental good in our own minds is able to commune with the good in others', so as to ally together and jointly drive out the darkness. There is tremendous heartache as we discover just how much damage we had previously been causing in the name of good --- and just how deeply ingrained that pattern still is in society at large.

To get a hint of why it is so damaging, reflect on how easy it is to pick up on sanctimony from another person, and how powerfully that triggers our defense mechanisms. Are we more likely to consider such a person's perspective or to see *them* as bad in return? Conversely, reflect on a time when you were acting poorly and yet someone gave you the benefit of the doubt — particularly when others were unwilling or unable to. Did it not stir the goodness in you, as though rising to their vision of what was possible for you? At our core, we are *all* like that.

When we attack the darkness in others, we only entrench it. This has the effect of confirming to ourselves that we are good people and they are bad --- which is actually why our egos adopted this counterproductive strategy in the first place. It is as though the *darkness* in our own minds is communing with the darkness in theirs, so that this shadowy principle may entrench itself more firmly in both hosts — a strategy that is remarkably effective, given how well it evades our notice. We convince ourselves that we are doing *good*, even though deep down we know better.

After such an awakening, this horrific enterprise becomes practically *palpable*. It is a heartbreaking revelation: nobody would actually *want* to be unkind, if only they could see clearly the harm it causes them — and yet, they can't seem to help themselves; and in response we cannot help *our*selves; ad infinitum, in a never-ending cycle of violence. Seeing this, one can no more hate others for such unskillful behavior than one could hate one's own child for inflicting self-harm, even when it also harms others. Such hatred would simply be more of the very problem one is trying to solve, and one is fed up with adding to the already-enormous load of our species.

One does not gain any Brownie points or become a "good person" for realizing any of this. Instead, being unfailingly kind is recognized as its own reward: it is merely the most straightforward way to accomplish what is clearly the most meaningful goal of all, and what the heart ultimately desires most: the end of suffering.
