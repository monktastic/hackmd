# Radical kindness

While on a months-long meditation retreat many years ago, I experienced a profound shift in perception that I think is worth sharing, regarding the nature of evil. I will describe it in mystical-sounding language. If that triggers you, please consider it poetry.

One aspect of your mind already knows everything I'm about to say, and another aspect will find it hopelessly naïve. Please try reading through the first lens.

The fundamental nature of mind is *pure Love; primordial Goodness.* It is what you most deeply *are*, and what everyone else is, too. What differs is how *estranged* we are from it.

You would think that the more estranged a person is from Love, the *sadder* they would appear. But because it is the source of Good, the more estranged they are, the more *evil* they actually appear. This is what all evil ultimately *is*. The further they get, the harder it becomes to recognize as estrangement, and the more clearly it appears to be a character flaw. But nobody would actually *want* to be marooned from Home, if only they could remember what it's like.

We think that "bad people" *deserve* our contempt. But how could someone who's estranged from Love "deserve" to be pushed further from it? This is how *new evil* is born --- usually in the name of "good."

Their increased evil confirms to us that *we were right about them* --- alleviating any misgivings we might have had about our behavior, and justifying escalation --- but *why don't we see our role in creating it?*

Our allies cheer us on, but why can't we see that we've only darkened their minds, too? Meanwhile, our target and their allies now perceive *us* as evil --- and in an important sense they are correct: we are trapped in the same confusion that we always see clearly in others but somehow never in ourselves.

We feel that *the ends justify the means*, but the ends that we tell ourselves we're accomplishing are not the ends that our subconscious is secretly accomplishing through us: the *entrenchment of darkness in the world.*

Why on Earth would someone whose "true nature is Love" *entrench darkness in the world?*

We have a primal need to know ourselves as good. When we are alienated from genuine Goodness, we must settle for the next best thing: *self-righteousness.* The only way to keep this supply fresh is to perpetually push others down. But it is absolutely crucial that we never suspect --- let alone admit --- that we are doing any of this, because that would destroy the *insanely clever* illusion we are so carefully crafting.

The more ensnared we become in this trap, the more we must hide it from ourselves. This takes the form of increasingly convincing evidence that what we're doing is *right*; and that anyone who doesn't see it is at best naïve, and probably an enemy. In this way, a person or group caught in this trap tragically seals itself off from the one thing it desires most: *genuine Goodness.* If left unchecked, the inevitable result of such mutual escalation is war.

The only solution is to reconnect, in some way, with that *Goodness.* This can happen in varying degrees through meditation, psychedelics, or even just a chance encounter with someone insistent on seeing the good within us at a critical moment when others (and even *we*) cannot. When we make *full* contact with this Love, it is impossible to overstate the catharsis that results.

Suddenly our eyes are opened to the devastation we've been perpetrating in the name of good. We discover that we've *always* known that we were doing this, but somehow hid it from ourselves. We see that everyone else is caught in exactly the same trap, and that we were never any better than them. It is a heartbreaking tragedy of epic proportions: it is precisely where love is needed the most that we withhold it the most. Our innocent desire to know ourselves as good has resulted in so much bad.

We vow to recognize when others are secretly calling for help in the form of "evil" --- and discover this happening in *infinitely more places and ways* than we could have ever imagined, let alone believed. We will not always have the energy to respond to such calls, or even the wisdom to know how, but now we at least see them for what they are, allowing us not to push people further in.

Our "enemies" can subconsciously perceive this shift in us. They can sense that we are trustworthy in a way that we very much weren't before; in a way that not even their allies are, given how blinded they are by *the cause*. They sense that we are a step in the direction back to the Wholeness they crave --- which is the only real way anyone "becomes good" or that "evil is destroyed." Dialogue becomes possible. Deep traumas have a safe channel to be released. Instead of finding ways to secretly *entrench* darkness, our subconscious is finding ways to secretly *uproot* it.

Before such an awakening, we fear that Love is sometimes the wrong response; that it will be used against us. This fear is not entirely unwarranted: the mind's distorted version of Love is a weak simulacrum of the real thing; a vague warm-and-fuzzy feeling that seeks to avoid conflict and *does* run that risk. But genuine Love has the power of a *thousand blazing suns*, and can manifest as absolutely anything; from a gentle smile, to mockery and shaming, or [worse](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/), as the situation warrants. We now see that it is *always* the right motivation, if only we learn to harness it wisely.

This doesn't mean we are out of the woods. It is all too easy to fall back into our old habits. The mind is infinitely tricky, making it surprisingly difficult to detect when we've fallen out of compassion and back into *self-righteousness.* This is especially true given that (approximately) the same behavior can be manifested through either channel. And being "awakened" in this sense isn't binary. It's a process that slowly saturates our being. But at least now we can recognize the telltale signs of being seduced by darkness[^utah], giving us some ability to resist it.

As more people are thus inoculated, the virulent cycle that perpetuates evil becomes increasingly unable to sustain itself. This is the only mechanism that can actually *undo* evil in the world, instead of merely suppressing it. And it is hard to imagine anything the world needs more right now than that.

May all beings be happy. 🙏🏽

### On awakening through psychedelics

From an online web forum (emphasis mine):

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
> 
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

From a first-time user of the empathogen MDMA (emphasis mine):

> *My mind brought up memories of being hit by my parents. I felt warmth and love towards them. I could see the bigger frame of everything and expanded my compassion towards them. I could feel their own confusion and see the love behind their actions. I could see them as children. … So, my basic view of the world began to shift. … Instead of seeing myself as a shit-sandwich with occasional bright moments, **I saw myself as basically good with some bad habits I picked up along the way... a white screen with some dark spots.***

### The shadow and projection

> *What bothers us about others, what we dislike or fear in them, are aspects of ourselves that they mirror back at us, aspects we dislike seeing. Until we make deep peace with such aspects of ourselves, unwanted aspects we don’t want to see, by learning to receive a love that touches in past them to the intrinsic goodness of our being, we can’t open to the intrinsic goodness of others that also lies hidden from our view.*
>
> *We need to receive love from those who have sent it to us just as we are, with all our flaws, in order to relax into the deeper goodness within us that always deserves such love and to heal there. Then we can offer a love in turn that embraces others with similar flaws, that touches in on their intrinsic worth, mirrors their goodness back at them, and doesn’t give up on them no matter what.*

> *If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn't part of ourselves doesn't disturb us.* --- Herman Hesse

> *Not that these others are wholly without blame, for even the worst projection is at least hung on a hook, perhaps a very small one, but still a hook offered by the other person.* --- Carl Jung

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* --- Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* --- Carl Jung


> *If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.* --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago


[^utah]: This quote may help you sense what I am talking about. Don't focus on whether it is *true* or not, but on how it makes you *feel*:

    > *"The earth is not dying, it is being killed. And those that are killing it have names and addresses."* --- Utah Phillips
    
    The feeling you're looking for is something like this: "yay, we found the evil, and now all we have to do is *smash* it!"
