> _Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle_ --- Unknown

We've all had the experience of doing something that we know to be wrong while pretending that it isn't. The part of us that knows it's wrong doesn't actually want to be doing it, but is drowned out by a louder voice justifying it.

When someone calls us out for this behavior in a nasty way, they're not trying to help us. They perceive us as a _bad person_, and bad people can't be helped. The most that can be done is to make them _feel bad_ so that they stop misbehaving due to social pressure. If that doesn't work, next comes escalating force.

Such cruelty might actually get you to stop --- at least, while other people are watching. But what you _feel_ is that this person not only badly misunderstood you, but is a profound hypocrite. They claim to be doing a noble thing by mistreating you, but part of them knows _damn well_ that this isn't helpful. Your resulting resentment is actually going to make you misbehave _more_ in the future, albeit in less-visible ways. At a very minimum, you will now perceive _them_ as a bad person --- and you both know where that story leads.

Now for the shocking part: this whole thing was actually _orchestrated_ --- not exactly by them or by you, but by the darkness in _both_ of your minds. The darkness in theirs was lying in wait, searching for a chance to embed its nasty tentacles deeper into the world --- and the darkness in yours just gave it the perfect opportunity. After all, they are only "fighting evil" --- and how could that ever be wrong? On the surface, the two of you may be enemies, but at a deeper level, your evil is secretly _allied._ There is actually only one evil, and it is distributed across minds, scanning for opportunities to link up.

It's impossible to overstate how insidious this ruse is. Precisely _because_ it is so evil, none of us can admit --- even to ourselves --- that this is what we're really doing. And that's exactly what allows it to operate with impunity. Any time you are scanning for "bad people" to fight with contempt; any time you are feeling self-righteous; this is what your mind is secretly conspiring to do.

This is why it is said that we should be kind to even bad people. It's not about what they deserve, and it's definitely not about being _nice._ Kindness can be as firm, or wrathful, or even violent as the situation calls for. But it is never contemptuous. That is only ever a sign of impending evil. Being free of this trap allows you to perceive the situation more clearly. Over time, other peoples' "great battles" become increasingly visible --- even in cases where it previously felt naive or dangerous to consider that their behavior was actually caused by one.

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ --- Alexander Solzhenitsyn
