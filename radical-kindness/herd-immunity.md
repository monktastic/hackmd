# Herd immunity against evil

When it comes to addressing the problem of evil in the world, I think there is a nice analogy with Covid: to the degree that we are still susceptible ourselves, we are liable to spread it more than we cure it. Moreover, we may not even realize that we're doing so: the contagion often spreads out of sight, long after we've patted ourselves on the back for a job well done.

We see someone misbehaving, so we yell at them to remind them of what an awful person they are. The behavior stops; mission accomplished. But when they go home, what are they spreading to their family? Goodwill? Or a reminder that the world is a nasty place that requires an even harder shell --- perhaps with an example to make sure they understand?

Their child grows up to be a bully; maybe even the kind you hear about on the news. We see this and think "What a nasty child. No, wait, we can't blame children: what terrible parents." By this point, our own complicity is so far removed that we feel safe rounding it down to zero, or maybe even a little less.
