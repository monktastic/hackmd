# Herd immunity against evil

When it comes to addressing the problem of evil in the world, I think there is a nice analogy with physical viruses: to the degree that we are still susceptible ourselves, we are liable to spread it more than we cure it. Moreover, we may not even realize that we're doing so: the contagion often spreads out of sight, long after we've patted ourselves on the back for a job well done.

Learning to be kind is a civic duty: you are contributing to our species' herd immunity against _evil itself._

This is why Carl Jung said:

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* --- Carl Jung
