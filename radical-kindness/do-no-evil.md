# Do no evil

There's an insidious process at work in your mind that is _very_ hard to see. It actively makes the world a worse place even as it claims to be doing the opposite. It is _insanely_ clever at hiding itself from you, so you may not believe what I am about to say unless you've already seen it for yourself.

We like to divide the world into "good" and "bad" people. We are then nice to the good people, and cruel to the bad. We think we're doing this to deter bad behavior, but this is a ruse.

The _actual_ reason we are cruel to bad people is to make them _worse_. This way, we can prove to the world that they really _are_ bad, thus justifying our cruel behavior, and vindicating us as the "good guys." This is the actual goal: to prove ourselves good.

When you mock your political enemies, don't they just dig in their heels? They increasingly see _you_ as evil, and vow to fight harder. You may wring your hands at their recalcitrance, but part of you wants nothing more than to keep escalating this game.

It is extremely painful when you first discover this aspect of your mind. You realize, with a shock, that you have been caught in _exactly_ the same trap as all the "bad people" you've been judging. The details differ from person to person, but the mechanism is exactly the same. It feels like this: "There is evil out there. I must defeat it at any cost—even if it means I must become a tiny bit evil myself. _Mine_ is actually good."

This belief is _flawlessly_ compelling. I could try to convince you that it's false, but that wouldn't work. You will easily be able to prove to me that your cruelty _will_ improve the world in this particular case. But if you look more closely—and this is the hard part—you will invariably detect self-deception at work. It is only once you see how difficult it is to detect it in yourself that you begin to have compassion for others.

That is the difference between being _nice_ and being _kind_. _Nice_ is how you treat people who deserve your compassion. _Kind_ is how you behave once you see that this whole game of dividing the world into "people who deserve my compassion" and "people who don't" is just a trap[1]. Compassion is the intention to _end_ this whole stupid game, and it makes zero sense to want that for some but not for others.

Your mind will give you endless reasons why this game _cannot_ end, because there are some people who are just intrinsically evil. Therefore, compassion sometimes really _is_ the wrong motivation. Whether that is true or not, those are the times to be _especially_ on lookout for self-deception. The more you can detect it in such moments, the more clearly you will discover your own "inner light"—and the more easily you can share it with others, thus doing _actual_ good in the world.

[^1] To be clear, kindness often manifests as behavior that is "nice," but not always. Sometimes it must be fierce, or perhaps even [violent]((https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)). The key point is that it is absent of self-deception. Experientially, this feels something like "love"—which is actually your deepest orientation toward reality.
