    > There are those that understand what [Nagel is alluding to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Is_It_Like_to_Be_a_Bat) with his description of conscious experience as the "what-it-is-like-to-be-me", and those that are blind to it, and members of these two groups have no common ground that would permit such a debate. Members of the former group have had the experience of being perplexed after a kind of reversal of attention back upon itself, leading them to 'notice' something that has not been noticed by members of the latter group. ... Consequently members of the latter group, who are blind to the issue, are also blind to their error in any claims they make about it. There can be no common ground between these two groups, one claiming that the other is seeing something that isn't there, the other claiming that the first is not seeing something that is there. They will forever be at loggerheads...

    Such "reversal of attention" is actually one of the [classic ways to awaken](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen/comments/z0c0p6/turn_the_light_around/) in Zen.
