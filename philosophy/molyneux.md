# Molyneux and the ineffability of everything

How could you describe the color red to a person born blind? It's an age-old question, and one that reveals just how much of our direct experience we take for granted.

It should be obvious that the specific color isn't important here; it would be just as difficult to describe _blue_ or any other shade. In fact, there's no reason it should be limited to colors or vision. How could you describe _anything_ to _anyone_ who was missing the relevant sensory perception? You couldn't. This may be obvious, and yet we have the tendency to believe that if we just tried hard enough; just used evocative enough language; that we could somehow get through. Consider these popular responses on Reddit:

> If you mean what [red] is _qualitatively_ like, I'd say that it's a visual quality which is like the taste of something spicy or the feeling of something hot or the smell of something earthy but tangy or the sound of a major sixth--or something like this.

> It tastes like a strawberry, and smells like a rose. Red is considered a warm color, related to heat.

> It’s the taste of ripe strawberries with the feeling of warmth from the sun. It’s passion, love and anger. It’s a color that demands your attention.

These are beautiful and poetic, but do they in any way "describe red"? Of course not. A similar conundrum was [posed by the philosopher Molyneux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molyneux%27s_problem) in the 17th century:

> _Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal [and of nearly the same size], so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: [the question is], whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?_

A common intuition seems to be that yes, _of course_ he could visually distinguish the cube from the sphere without touching them. After all, one is _pointy_ and the other _round_ — features that are obvious both to the visual and tactile senses. But if you believe this, you'd be falling into the very same trap. You might be able to talk yourself out of this belief through logic, but there probably remains a hidden suspicion that such a thing might be possible.

I think it is this subtle belief — that our experiences _might_ be describable — that holds us back from truly getting in touch with life. You see, when we believe that a thing can be reduced to some other thing, we tend to take it for granted — and it turns out that we subconsciously believe this about our entire lived experience, all the time. We don't really see things _as they are,_ but as we narrate them to ourselves with our concepts. And because we believe that one is a faithful stand-in for the other — albeit an imperfect one — we never bother trying to correct this mistake. We don't even think it _is_ one. Thus it is that a human can go an entire lifetime without ever actually contacting the sheer texture of life.

This problem goes far beyond the personal. Modern civilization has taught us that our conscious experience can be reduced to neuronal firings, which in turn can be reduced to a fundamentally lifeless substance called "matter." This is fine as far as descriptions go, but we've learned to take it _literally_ — and the result is tragic beyond measure. It is precisely because we do not _look_ at the miracle engulfing us that we take it for granted, and because we take it for granted that we are able to treat it with such contempt. It is this overlooking of the sheer magic of existence that is degrading it; causing it to wither away into nothing. That is the root cause of our collapsing biosphere and civic connection. We believe we _know what this is,_ when we actually haven't got a clue.

These ideas may seem disconnected: why on Earth should humility about the nature of existence cause us to love it — or each other — more? In principle, there is no necessary connection. And yet, this is what people repeatedly find. By humbling ourselves, and being open to the possibility that we _just don't know_, we find ourselves slowly opening out into the grand mystery of it all. The grip of ego loosens, and we start to sense that perhaps even the aggression we see in others is ultimately just a defense mechanism to protect against the terror of not-knowing. As we demonstrate that it's safe to not-know — indeed, not just safe but somehow everything we ever wanted — we find that something in others begins to soften, too. We discover that even the most hard-hearted individual ultimately just wanted the same thing we all want: to be free of the need to grip so tightly all the time. After all, if it all really is just sand slipping through our fingers, what would be the point in gripping?
