# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and infinitely precious, your every action has cosmic consequence, and _everything_ somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. Moreover, it is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

As beautiful as such ideas may sound, how can we be sure they're not just delusion, born of rogue neurotransmitters ruthlessly evolved to distract us from the cold, hard, truth: that ours is a fundamentally lifeless world of "pitiless indifference"[^Dawkins]? Although this latter view is indeed the root cause of the ennui and despair that are killing us—along with all life on the planet—we still should not abandon the truth for a fantasy.

But what if it is _not_ fantasy? What if it's not only true, but _verifiable_ in a specific way that mere beliefs—religious, scientific, or otherwise—could never even theoretically be? It would be a shame if this ship went down with the astonishing truth right under our noses all along.

You _seem_ to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space. But if this is true, then the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from confirming it with literally _any_ degree of certainty. As far as you know, your senses (and reasoning) have been hijacked by a clever demon, and your whole world is a lie. In fact, _this_ might be the very first moment of your existence—despite what your (false) memories tell you. There is no way to estimate even the _probability_ that this is the case.

This seems vexing, until you discover the following solution: since _all_ views are equally unverifiable, you are logically free to choose whichever you like best—so why not the default view? Problem solved! Or is it? Notice that this solution _assumes_ that you are, indeed, an individual being relying on evidence and reasoning to _infer_ the nature of your reality—a fundamentally fraught endeavor. But how do you know that you _are_ such a being? Because it's "obvious"? Can you sense how this is itself a clever trap?

The only thing you know for sure is that _something seems to be happening._ Pause and confirm this. This fact seems utterly unremarkable, and so we usually ignore it. This is a major mistake, and comically absurd: we constantly overlook the _one irrefutable thing_ in favor of _ideas_ about it that we have literally no reason to believe in the first place[^no-consciousness].

What if you reversed this, and instead fully immersed your attention in _that-which-is-unmistakably-here_, while deeply releasing the pretense of having _any idea_ what it is or what's causing it? Remember, you don't even know that you've experienced anything _before_ this very moment. If you manage to do this very precisely and sincerely, what happens is remarkable, indeed.

> _Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment._ — Rumi

You soon begin to experience a wonder and awe that you may not have felt since childhood. There are now two options: turn back, or continue chasing the rabbit down the hole. Turning back simply requires re-adopting your usual worldview: _Wow, physical reality is awesome. How wondrous that my brain (which totally exists) can have this "spiritual" experience!_ Any attempt, no matter how subtle, to interpret "this" in terms of _something else_ (such as "physical reality") will cause you to take it for granted, and thereby fail to look it full in the face. 

If you manage to carefully avoid these traps your mind is setting for you, there will eventually be a breakthrough. You will be brought to your knees with a reverence, awe, humility, joy, and love that you never dreamed possible. What happens is like stepping through the looking glass; a complete inversion of everything you took to be "real" up until that point.

You perceive precisely _why_ your old world view was impossible to prove: it was a fictional drama you invented to hide from the "astonishing light" that is always right here. This is impossible to describe accurately, so please forgive the poetry:

What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite, Love. So is everyone and everything else—and you _are_ them. You are [_all_ of it, very cleverly pretending that you're not]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckiNNgfMKcQ)). You hide in plain sight, by taking the shape of a "mundane" reality. There you lie in wait, until reminders of your Love begin to pierce the veil and rouse you from eons of slumber.

It may sound like I am describing just another worldview; one that you should therefore be equally skeptical of. I am not describing an idea, but something more like a _process_—one that you already know perfectly well deep down.

Why should you take this possibility seriously? This is the hardest question to answer, and all we can offer is a hint:

_If you really _were_ the self-aware ground of reality, what kind of experience could you possibly equip yourself with as a way to validate this truth beyond any doubt when the time came?_ 

It turns out that _no_ experience could possibly do this: simply by virtue of being "an experience," it would already be subject to the _problem of skepticism_, and therefore be inherently unreliable. No matter how strongly it _felt_ like the experience was revealing an ultimate truth, there would be no reason to take it seriously. 

But _awakening_ is not an experience of any sort. It is more like a direct insight into the very _nature_ of experience. It cannot be directly communicated between (apparent) individual beings, because then it could not be self-validating in the required way. That is what makes it so frustrating to talk about.

Nonetheless, the key insight is this: if you really _are_ the ground of reality, then nothing logically prevents you from confirming this fact, unlike for the case of an individual being. It may be impossible to understand _how_—but by simply doing the most radically honest thing possible, you cannot fail to discover it[^why].

Something inside you wants to believe that we're here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our being—and another part fears that this is just a pretty story generated by the meat in your skull, to help propagate your genes. Only one of these possibilities can even theoretically be confirmed, while the other is pure fantasy. It's time we finally realized which is which.

> _Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I_ am _them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally._

> _But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too._

### Footnotes

[^Dawkins]: _"The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference."_ — Richard Dawkins

[^simulation]: At least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality."

[^no-consciousness]: If you go far enough in that direction, you will eventually convince yourself that _nothing_ seems to be happening, and that only your _ideas_ about reality are true:
    * [Daniel Dennett](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/daniel-dennetts-science-of-the-soul)
    * [Keith Frankish](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-your-consciousness-is-an-illusion-created-by-your-brain)
    * [Michael Graziano](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/consciousness-color-brain/423522/)

[^why]: I don't have a good explanation of _why_ we (as apparently individual beings) avoid seeing this, other than to say that a deep part of us somehow feels unworthy of such profound majesty. This is why being kind brings you closer to seeing it, and unkindness takes both you and the "rest of us" further away: it reminds you of what you _are_—and that you are more worthy of knowing this than you can possibly imagine, despite [countless lifetimes of horrific mistakes]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)).

    (And on the flip side, being unkind to others—even "bad people"—pushes you and them further from realization. You are here to remind them of what they really are. This is true kindness, which is [not the same as being nice](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/).)
