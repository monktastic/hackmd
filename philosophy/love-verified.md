# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and infinitely precious, your every action has cosmic consequence, and _everything_ somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. Moreover, it is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

As beautiful as these ideas may sound, how can we be sure that they're not just delusion, born of neurotransmitters ruthlessly evolved to distract us from the cold, hard, truth: that ours is a fundamentally lifeless world of "pitiless indifference"[^Dawkins]? Although that view is the root cause of the ennui and despair that are destroying us, we should not abandon the truth for a fantasy.

But what if it is _not_ fantasy? What if it's not only true, but _verifiable_ in a way that mere beliefs—religious, scientific, or otherwise—could never even theoretically be? It would be a shame if this ship went down with the astonishing truth right under our noses all along.

> _Most of us suspect we don’t really know what life is. But really knowing you don't know takes some work. It requires you to clearly see that your story is just a story; and to become conscious of the deep mystery at its foundation._ — Tim Freke

You _seem_ to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space. But if this is true, the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from confirming it with literally any certainty whatsoever. For example, not only can you not prove whether this is a simulation; you cannot even meaningfully calculate the _probability_ that it is[^simulation]. Similarly, you cannot call it "likely" that the past really happened.

One way to deal with this is to point out that it doesn't matter: if there is really no way to tell the difference between views, then in some sense there _isn't_ one—and we are therefore free to carry on _as though_ our usual view is correct. This response is logically impeccable, but it's secretly just a clever trap your mind uses to prevent you from seeing something. From seeing _everything_, actually.

The only thing you know for sure is that _something seems to be happening._ Pause and confirm this. This fact seems utterly unremarkable, and so we usually ignore it. This is a major mistake, and comically absurd: we constantly overlook the _one irrefutable thing_ in favor of _ideas_ about it that we have literally no reason to believe in the first place[^no-consciousness]. We then call this "rational" and "sophisticated."

What if you reversed this? What if you were to fully immerse your attention in _that-which-is-unmistakably-here_, while deeply releasing the pretense of having _any idea_ what it is or what's causing it? Remember, you don't even know that you've experienced anything _before_ this very moment.

Notice how this is the most radically honest thing you could possibly do. If you manage to do it very precisely and sincerely, what happens is remarkable, indeed.

> _Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment._ — Rumi

You will soon begin to experience a wonder and awe that you may not have felt since childhood. There are now two options: turn back, or continue chasing the rabbit down the hole. Turning back simply requires that you frame this rising sense of miraculousness in terms of your usual worldview: _Wow, physical reality is awesome. How wondrous that my brain (which totally exists) can experience this!_

Any attempt, no matter how subtle, to interpret "this" in terms of _something else_ will cause you to take it for granted, and thereby fail to look it directly in the face. If you manage to carefully avoid these traps your mind is setting for you, there will eventually be a breakthrough. 

You will be brought to your knees with a reverence, awe, humility, joy, and love that you never thought possible. What happens then is like stepping through the looking glass; a complete inversion of everything you took to be "real" up until that point.

You perceive exactly _why_ your old world view was impossible to prove: it was a fictional drama you invented, to hide from the "astonishing light" that is always right here. This is impossible to describe accurately, so please forgive the poetry:

What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite, Love. So is everyone and everything else—and you _are_ them. You are [_all_ of it, pretending that you're not]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckiNNgfMKcQ)). You hide in plain sight, by taking the shape of a "mundane" reality. There you lie in wait, until reminders of your Love begin to pierce the veil and rouse you from eons of slumber.

It may sound like I am describing just another worldview; one that you should be equally skeptical of. I am not describing an idea, but something more like a _process_—one that you already know perfectly well.

> So deep you can't fathom it <br/>
> So simple you can't believe it <br/>
> So good you can't accept it* <br/>

If you really are the self-aware _ground of reality,_ then perhaps you have given yourself a way to confirm this in a direct, non-inferential way—one that is therefore not subject to the problem of skepticism. Nothing logically prevents this, as it would if you really _were_ a separate being.  Luckily, you do not have to take my word for it: by simply doing the most radically honest thing possible, you cannot fail to discover it.

I don't have a good explanation of _why_ we avoid seeing this, other than to say that a deep part of us somehow feels unworthy of such profound majesty. This is why being kind brings you closer to seeing it, and unkindness takes both you and the "rest of us" further away[^bad-people]: it reminds you of what you _are_—and that you are more worthy of knowing this than you can possibly imagine, despite [countless lifetimes of horrific mistakes]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)).

Something inside you wants to believe that we're here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our being—and another part fears that this is just an illusion generated by the meat in your skull. Only one of these possibilities can even theoretically be confirmed, while the other is pure fantasy. It's time we realized which is which.

> _Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I_ am _them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally._

> _But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too._

### Footnotes

[^Dawkins]: _"The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference."_ — Richard Dawkins

[^simulation]: At least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality."

[^no-consciousness]: If you go far enough in that direction, you will eventually convince yourself that _nothing_ seems to be happening, and that only your _ideas_ about reality are true:

[^bad-people]: And on the flip side, being unkind to others—even "bad people"—pushes you and them further from realization. You are here to remind them of what they really are. This is true kindness, which is [not the same as being nice](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/).
