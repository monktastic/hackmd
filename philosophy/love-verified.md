# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and fundamentally miraculous, your every action has cosmic consequence, and _everything_ somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. Moreover, it is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

This may be a beautiful view, but why should we trust it over the modern scientific understanding—that we live in a fundamentally lifeless world of "pitiless indifference"[^Dawkins]? Even if this latter view is the root cause of the ennui and despair that are killing our planet, we should not abandon the truth for a fantasy.

But what if it's _not_ fantasy? What if it's not only true, but _verifiable_ in a way that no other beliefs—religious, scientific, or otherwise—could even theoretically be?

We've had it backwards this whole time. It would be a shame if this ship went down with the truth right under our noses.

You _seem_ to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space. But if this is true, the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from knowing it with literally any certainty whatsoever. For example, not only can you not prove whether this is a simulation; you cannot even meaningfully calculate the probability that it is[^simulation]. Similarly, you cannot call it "likely" that the past really happened. This is not mysticism, but the _epitome_ of rationality.

There are two ways you might respond. The first is to point out that it doesn't matter: if there is really no way to tell the difference between views, then in some sense, there _isn't_ one. Therefore, we are free to carry on _as though_ our usual view is correct. This answer is logically impeccable, but it's hiding something. Actually, it's hiding _everything_, as we shall see.

The other thing you might do is ask yourself: well, what _can_ I be sure of? You'll discover that all you know for sure is that _something seems to be happening._ Go ahead and confirm this. This fact seems utterly unremarkable, and so we usually ignore it. This is a huge mistake, and comically absurd: we constantly overlook the _one unmistakable thing_ in favor of _ideas_ about it that we have no reason to believe in the first place. We take our reality on blind faith and call this "rational."

So how do you go about seeing the "one unmistakable thing"? Well, you just look — but pointers sometimes help.

> _Sell your cleverness and buy bewilderment._ — Rumi

The "trick" is to fully immerse your attention in _that-which-seems-to-be-happening_ while carefully avoiding the seductive illusion that you have any idea what it is, where it came from, what's causing it, etc. For all you know, you've never experienced anything _before_ this. That's a big hint.

As you do this, you may begin to feel a wonder, awe, and joy that you recognize from early childhood. But your adult mind is "sophisticated," and will try to interpret the process using its supposed knowledge: _Wow, physical reality is awesome. How wondrous that my brain—which totally exists—can experience this!_ This may _feel_ like "it," but it's not. It is as though every time you try to step off the cliff, your mind builds a new platform under your foot.

As long as your mind believes—or even suspects—that "this" can be explained in terms of _something else_, you will necessarily take it for granted, and thereby fail to look directly at it. On the other hand, the suggestion that it _cannot_ be so explained will grate on your rational mind, preventing you from taking the process completely seriously—despite the fact that it has no reason to believe in a "something else" to begin with.

The solution is to drop the need for sophistication. It is only a defense mechanism. To be clear, this isn't about abandoning rationality in favor of magical thinking. It only requires being honest and humble about what you do and do not know. In fact, this is the most radically honest thing you could possibly do. That is the only way you can be sure you're not fooling yourself with yet another illusion.

So what happens if you manage to actually step off the cliff?

Describing the "breakthrough" is impossible, and it happens differently for everyone. But if I had to isolate the key component, it is this: it is a complete inversion of what you took to be _real_ up until that point; like stepping through the looking glass.

It is one thing to _understand_ how all your beliefs are unjustified, but something else entirely to _see_ it. The latter involves directly perceiving the source of those beliefs, and why you adopted them in the first place. As I said, it is impossible to communicate, but I'll say some words.

The reason you couldn't prove that time and space exist is because they _don't_, in a particular sense. You were imagining them. The closest analogy we have in modern science is that "[your brain hallucinates your conscious reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo)"—except the idea that it is "your brain" doing the hallucinating is just part of the hallucination. The truth is infinitely stranger still.

That is why mystics resort to poetry. It is not a _description_ of the way things are, but a whisper in a bottle, bobbing its way toward your Heart. With that in mind:

You are presently engulfed in a miracle _beyond your wildest imagination._ You're not just engulfed in it; you _are_ it—the _entirety_ of it. This "miracle" is not far away; it is, as the Tibetans say:

> *So close you can't see it <br/>
> So deep you can't fathom it <br/>
> So simple you can't believe it <br/>
> So good you can't accept it* <br/>

It is so blinding that you choose to avert your gaze, thereby perceiving a fundamentally lifeless world instead. You still harbor a faint memory of your primordial Home, but to assuage your deep regret over having abandoned it, you write the idea off as "irrational," and call this "sophisticated."

> _Reality is that which, when you stop believing it, doesn't go away._ – Philip K. Dick.

That mundane world does indeed "go away" when you stop believing in it. It is not _real_. It is a spooky campfire story that got out of hand. Nothing more.

You know that feeling when you desire nothing more in the world than to take away another being's pain—for no other reason than it's obviously _right_? That isn't just one quality you have among many; it's _what you most fundamentally are_. It's what this _whole place_ is. It's all Love. There is nothing else to be done here but _that._ Except there are no "other beings"; it's [all _you_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI). No act of kindness is ever wasted—and conversely, no unkindness fails to manifest as harm somewhere within the Whole[^bad-people].

This truth can be known concretely, in a way that mere beliefs never can. Unlike beliefs, you don't have to infer it, because you _are_ it. This statement may not make much sense to you now, but the deepest part of you remembers. Follow that memory back to its source.

> _Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I_ am _them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally._

> _But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too._

Something inside you wants to believe that we're here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our being—and another part fears that this is just a nice story generated by the meat in your skull, ruthlessly evolved to distract you from the bleak truth: that ours is an intrinsically lifeless world of "pitiless indifference". Only one of these possibilities can even theoretically be confirmed, while the other is pure fantasy. It's time we realized which is which.

[^Dawkins]: _"The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference."_ — Richard Dawkins

[^simulation]: At least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality."

[^bad-people]: For example, being unkind to "bad people" tends to push them further into their delusion, which they then take out on others. We may believe that this is righteous, but all that has actually happened is that we've allowed the illusion that's driving their unkindness to infect our own minds. We then infect others, and form tribes (e.g., political parties) around our particular strain of infection. To be clear, [being kind is not the same as being nice](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/)—but that deserves its own piece.

[^compassion]: Whenever we perceive others as genuinely "other"; whenever we harbor contempt for them and their choices—however terrible they may be—we are running directly away from the one thing we most deeply desire: to return Home. They are _you_, and it would be foolish to forsake yourself. A deep part of you knows [exactly what I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI).
