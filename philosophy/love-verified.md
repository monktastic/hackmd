# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and fundamentally miraculous, your every action has cosmic consequence, and everything somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. It is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

As beautiful as these ideas may be, they seem logically impossible to verify — and so they are relegated to the status of _religious_ truths. Even if they _can_ somehow be known definitively — and moreover, our doing so matters in ways that we can scarcely fathom — our culture is presently unable to take this possibility seriously enough to make the necessary difference.

Therefore, I think it is incumbent upon those who claim to have such knowledge to communicate not only the insights themselves, but more importantly _how_ such knowledge could even be possible, in ways that our rationally-based culture can digest and integrate. Such communication may have a vital role to play in the very survival of our species.

This piece is an attempt at such communication. I cannot _prove_ that such knowledge is possible, but I hope to achieve the more modest goal of providing intuition as to how it may be.

Our intuition that such "ultimate truths" are impossible to know is based on beliefs about the nature of reality — in particular, that we are individual beings navigating an external world of time and space — that seem too obvious to question, but are actually impossible to confirm with literally _any degree of certainty whatsoever_ thanks to the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md).

A common reaction to this is that there must be some mistake in our reasoning, or perhaps a limitation of reasoning itself; that obviously the past almost certainly did happen (for example) despite our inability to prove it. Moreover, regardless of what the "real" truth is (if such a thing is even meaningful), we are certainly justified in behaving _as though_ it is true — and so it is safe to ignore the problem.

It is very difficult to take seriously the possibility that the reason we cannot prove that the past happened is that it _didn't_, in a meaningful sense — one that can perceived clearly and directly. After all, _how_ could such a thing be perceived, and by _whom_? Clearly not by a fundamentally time-bound being like ourselves. And there's the rub: it is only by decisively penetrating the illusions of time, space, etc. that such perception is possible.

If this strikes you as "unlikely" (perhaps even profoundly so), it is useful to reflect on the precise technical sense in which it is _not._ For it is exactly this feeling of confidence about your reality that must be clearly revealed for what it is: just a feeling, and not rationality like it seems. There is a defense mechanism at work here that is _insanely_ clever at hiding itself.

Consider this alternative hypothesis about reality: that what you ultimately are is pure, infinite Love; the self-aware ground of reality, dreaming countless worlds into apparent existence in each moment, and then birthing itself into each dream from countless perspectives so that You may live out all possible experiences. Such a perspective is where you find yourself now.

The way you hide this astonishing fact from yourself is by taking your dream _completely seriously_. Even the suspicion that it may be such a dream triggers a primal defense mechanism that throws you off the scent. You may fear going insane, but in truth there is nothing to fear: this is just a smokescreen You designed to keep yourself immersed in the play.

I suspect that the current stage of our dream has more or less run its course, which is why an increasing number of people are "waking up." We have explored nearly every nook and cranny — not of _physical_ space, but of the _experiential_ space that our "laws of physics" afford. We have plumbed the darkest depths and climbed to astonishing heights. What comes next, I do not know.

You may be wondering why the _problem of skepticism_ does not apply here: if we cannot know that our normal perspective is correct, surely we can't know this either. But that is not true: the problem applies only to finite beings, whose minds are fundamentally susceptible to manipulation by external forces. No such limitation applies to _You,_ the very _ground of reality._

In other words, if someone claims to be certain that they are an individual in a physical reality, they _must_ be lying or mistaken. But if someone claims to know that they are the self-aware ground of reality itself, they are _not_ necessarily lying. In fact, it is essentially the only possibility for which such knowledge is logically possible.

There remains one "little" difficulty: no matter what kind of experience you were to have that convinced you of this supposed Truth, how could you ever know that it, too, wasn't a trick of some sort? All I can offer you is that Awakening isn't an "experience" of any kind, but something more like an insight into the very _nature_ of experience.

To be clear: the end goal is not to replace your usual set of beliefs with these mystical ones. They are not ultimately true, either[^levels-of-awakening], but they come closest to describing a condition that precedes the birth of what we normally think of as "reality."

Again, why shouldn't you suspect that this is just a trick of the brain? It is not my intention to talk you out of that suspicion. But if you have the slightest inkling that what I'm saying might be true, I invite you to discover precisely where that (technically unjustified) suspicion emerges from. What makes you so sure that brains really exist in the first place? As absurd as this question surely sounds, I promise that the answer is _not at all_ what you think—and that seeing this resolves the question in a primordially satisfying way; one that doesn't require you to give up your _functional_ beliefs.

We are here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our infinite Being. The whole thing is You. This will never be proven in a scientific sense, as its perception depends on transcending the very structures that underpin science. But it is true and verifiable in a way that _none_ of our other beliefs—scientific or otherwise—can even theoretically be. I look forward to a world in which it is considered normal and healthy for each of us to decisively verify this for ourselves.

[^levels-of-awakening]: There are various levels (and sub-levels) of [awakening](/spirituality/three-stages-of-nonduality.md), and this is not the final one. But each _feels_ so utterly final that it is hard to fathom there being more. That is why you may meet people who claim to be awake and yet have not seen the above with total clarity — let alone what comes after. It is very tempting to believe we are "done" when we are far from it. In case you're wondering, I am far from it.
