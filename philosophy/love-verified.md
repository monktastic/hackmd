# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and infinitely precious, your every action has cosmic consequence, and _everything_ somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. Moreover, it is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

As beautiful as such ideas may sound, how can we be sure they're not just delusion, born of rogue neurotransmitters ruthlessly evolved to distract us from the cold, hard, truth: that ours is a fundamentally lifeless world of "pitiless indifference"[^Dawkins]? Although this latter view is the root cause of the ennui and despair that are killing us — along with all life on the planet — we still should not abandon the truth for a fantasy.

But what if it is _not_ fantasy? What if it's not only true, but _verifiable_ in a specific way that mere beliefs — religious, scientific, or otherwise — could never even theoretically be? It would be a shame if this ship went down with the astonishing truth right under our noses.

> _Most of us suspect we don’t really know what life is. But really knowing you don't know takes some work. It requires you to clearly see that your story is just a story; and to become conscious of the deep mystery at its foundation._ —Tim Freke

If you are deeply, profoundly honest with yourself, you will be forced to admit that you [don't have a clue what reality really is](radical-skepticism.md). The way that philosophers normally deal with this problem is the following: while there are many models of reality that are (or can be made) internally consistent — e.g., that this is all a dream or a simulation, etc. — the "simplest" solution is that physical reality is exactly what we think. So while we cannot verify that it is true in some ultimate sense, we are still justified in believing it.

This is all well and good, but there's one small problem: the deepest part of you knows that this belief isn't based on anything solid. Moreover, if this really _were_ a dream, then isn't it possible that your belief in its reality is what's causing it to appear stable and solid in the first place — which is in turn reinforcing that belief, etc., in a continuous feedback loop?

This possibility ought to weird you out more than it does. It opens the door to the possibility that there's something you can do "in here" that would reveal a deeper truth about what is going on "out there." And indeed, there is.

The only thing you know for sure is that _something seems to be happening._ Pause and confirm this. This fact seems utterly unremarkable, and so we usually ignore it. This is a major mistake, and comically absurd: we constantly overlook the _one irrefutable thing_ in favor of _ideas_ about it that we have literally no reason to believe in the first place[^no-consciousness].

What if you were to reverse this, and instead fully immersed your attention in _that-which-is-unmistakably-here_, while deeply releasing the pretense of having _any idea_ what it is or what's causing it? (You don't even know that you've experienced anything _before_ this very moment. As far as you can possibly know, reality suddenly popped into being in this very instant, with only the *appearance* of a real past.) If you manage to do this very precisely and sincerely, something remarkable may happen.

You will soon begin to experience a wonder and awe that you may not have felt since childhood. You then have two options: turn back, or continue chasing the rabbit down the hole. Turning back is as simple as stuffing this wonder into your usual worldview: _Wow, physical reality is awesome. How wondrous that my brain (which totally exists) can have a "spiritual" experience!_ 

See, any attempt, no matter how subtle, to interpret "this" in terms of _something else_ (such as "physical reality") will prevent you from looking it full in the face, thereby causing you to take it for granted. This is what must come to an end.

If you manage to carefully avoid all these traps your mind is setting for you, there will eventually be a breakthrough. You will be brought to your knees with a reverence, awe, humility, joy, and love that you never dreamed possible. What happens is like stepping through the looking glass; a complete inversion of everything you took to be "real" up until that point.

You will perceive precisely _why_ your old world view was impossible to prove: it was a fictional drama you invented to hide from the "astonishing light" that is always right here. This is impossible to describe accurately, so please forgive the poetry:

What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite, Love. So is everyone and everything else — and you _are_ them. You are [_all_ of it, very cleverly pretending that you're not]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckiNNgfMKcQ)). You hide in plain sight, by taking the shape of a "mundane" reality. There you lie in wait, until reminders of your Love begin to pierce the veil and rouse you from eons of slumber.

It may sound like I am describing just another worldview; one that you should therefore be equally skeptical of. I am not describing an idea, but something more like a _process_ — one that you already know perfectly well deep down.

How do you know that this kind of "awakening" isn't just another trick of the brain? After all, as far as we know, the brain can generate _any_ kind of experience.

This is the hardest thing to describe. _Awakening_ is not "an experience" of any sort. It is somehow _orthogonal_ to experience; a direct insight into its very _nature_. Before it happens to you, this description cannot *possibly* make any sense. It is pointing to something utterly beyond what your mind has firmly convinced you is "reality." That is what makes it so frustrating to talk about.

Nonetheless, the key insight is this: if you really _are_ the ground of reality, then nothing logically prevents you from confirming this fact in a way that would be literally impossible if reality were merely "physical" (given the [problem of skepticism](problem-of-skepticism.md). It may be impossible to understand _how_ such validation could be possible — but luckily, by simply doing _the most radically honest thing possible_, you cannot fail to discover it[^why].

Something inside you wants to believe that we're here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our being — and another part fears that this is just a pretty story generated by the meat in your skull, to help propagate your genes. Only one of these possibilities can even theoretically be confirmed, while the other is pure fantasy. It's time we finally realized which is which.

> _Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I_ am _them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally._

> _But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too._

### Footnotes

[^Dawkins]: _"The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference."_ — Richard Dawkins

[^simulation]: At least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality."

[^no-consciousness]: If you go far enough in that direction, you will eventually convince yourself that _nothing_ seems to be happening, and that only your _ideas_ about reality are true:

    * [Michael Graziano](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/consciousness-color-brain/423522/)

[^why]: I don't have a good explanation of _why_ we (as apparently individual beings) avoid seeing this, other than to say that a deep part of us somehow feels unworthy of such profound majesty. This is why being kind brings you closer to seeing it, and unkindness takes both you and the "rest of us" further away: it reminds you of what you _are_—and that you are more worthy of knowing this than you can possibly imagine, despite [countless lifetimes of horrific mistakes]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI)).

    (And on the flip side, being unkind to others—even "bad people"—pushes you and them further from realization. You are here to remind them of what they really are. This is true kindness, which is [not the same as being nice](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/).)
