# Love, verified

According to the mystical view, reality is radically alive and fundamentally miraculous, your every action has cosmic consequence, and everything somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. It is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

As beautiful as these ideas may be, they seem logically impossible to verify — and so they are relegated to the status of _religious_ truths. Even if they _can_ somehow be known definitively — and moreover, our doing so matters in ways that we can scarcely fathom — our culture is presently unable to take this possibility seriously enough to make the necessary difference.

Therefore, I believe it is urgent for those who claim to have such knowledge to communicate not only the insights themselves, but more importantly _how_ such knowledge could even be possible, in a way that our rationally-based culture can digest and integrate. Such communication may have a vital role to play in the very survival of our species.

This piece is an attempt at such communication. I cannot _prove_ that such knowledge is possible, but I hope to achieve the more modest goal of providing intuition as to how it may be.

Our intuition that such "ultimate truths" are impossible to know is rooted in beliefs about the nature of reality — in particular, that we are finite beings navigating a fundamentally external world — that seem too obvious to question, but are actually impossible to confirm with literally _any degree of certainty whatsoever_ thanks to the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md). Did the past really happen? Not only can we not _prove_ that it did; we cannot even meaningfully call it "likely."

A common reaction to this is that the fault must lie with our reasoning, or perhaps with reasoning itself; that obviously the past almost certainly did happen despite our inability to prove it. Moreover, regardless of what the "real" truth is (if such a thing is even meaningful), we are certainly justified in behaving _as though_ it is true — and so it is safe to ignore the problem.

We somehow cannot take seriously the possibility that the reason we cannot prove that the past really happened is that it _didn't_, in a meaningful sense — one that can perceived clearly and directly. After all, _how_ could such a thing be perceived, and by _whom_?

Consider this alternate hypothesis about reality: that what you ultimately are is pure, infinite Love; the self-aware ground of being, dreaming countless worlds into apparent existence in each moment, and then birthing yourself into each dream from countless perspectives, so that you may live out all possible experiences. You carefully hide this truth from yourself so that you may remain immersed in the drama — which is where you find yourself now.

At first, this hypothesis may sound as unprovable as the rest. But there's a crucial difference: as the very _ground of being_, you do not have to _infer_ the nature of your reality through sensory input and reasoning. Nothing logically prevents you from equipping yourself with a unique mode of knowledge that would let you confirm the Truth in an unmediated way.

That is what _awakening_[^levels-of-awakening] is. It isn't a particular kind of experience. If it were, you could never rule out that it was generated by your brain (or simulation overlords). It is a direct, non-conceptual insight into the _nature_ of experience. It cannot be communicated or imagined in any way. While this is frustrating, it is also the only way it could possibly be self-validating.

Spooky as that may sound, you've very likely had glimpses of it yourself—though you may not have registered them as such. They feel like a taste of transcendence; the sneaking suspicion that life may be genuinely miraculous in a way that you can't quite put your finger on, and that you don't dare admit in polite company, for fear of sounding crazy.

All that prevents these tiny tastes from blossoming into full-blown awakenings is the little voice in your "head" that pretends to know what is going on: that you are an individual being in a physical reality, and that any suspicion otherwise is just your brain playing tricks. Even if you can't be _certain_ of any of this, it is surely the "most rational" explanation.

But it is _not_ rational. You have _no idea_ what's going on—not even the first clue. All you know for sure is that something _seems_ to be happening—something genuinely astonishing. Take a look and confirm this[^seeming]. If you can remain precisely with this wondrous "something," while utterly dropping the pretense of having any idea what it is or what's causing it, you will begin to sense your way back Home.

None of this requires that you believe anything I've said. In fact, it is better that you don't. All that is required is to be profoundly honest about what you do and do not know. If you do this with the utmost sincerity and humility, the rest will take care of itself.

We are here to love each other and this miraculous "creation" with every ounce of our Being. The whole thing is You, after all. This will never be proven in the scientific sense, but it is true, and moreover _verifiable_ in a way that none of our other beliefs—scientific or otherwise—can even theoretically be. I look forward to a world that appreciates this possibility, and encourages each of us to verify it for ourselves.

[^levels-of-awakening]: There are various levels and degrees of [awakening](/spirituality/three-stages-of-nonduality.md), and this is actually not the final one. Many _believe_ it to be, and amongst those, many have not released certain belief structures deeply enough to perceive its full implications. Such people may consider the above description "woo," despite getting some of the psychological benefits. Later stages are too paradoxical for words, and anyway, I haven't realized them deeply enough to share. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbezCWitG_E) has and does.

[^seeming]: The ability to confirm that "something seems to be happening" could perhaps itself be considered a basic level of awakening. Believe it or not, not everyone has it yet—which is why [there are](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/daniel-dennetts-science-of-the-soul) still [philosophers](https://aeon.co/essays/what-if-your-consciousness-is-an-illusion-created-by-your-brain) and [scientists](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/01/consciousness-color-brain/423522/) who claim that consciousness is an illusion. Notice how it is self-validating: you _couldn't_ be wrong about it, in a sense that is literally impossible to communicate to them. That is how it is with later stages, too.
