# Why idealism?

If the mystical view of reality is correct, then everything you do matters in ways you cannot fathom, reality is miraculous beyond your wildest imagination, and _everything_ somehow hinges on the Love you dare express. Moreover, it is supposedly our inability to realize these truths that lies at the heart of the converging crises of our day.

These are beautiful ideas, but they seem logically impossible to verify—in which case we should be deeply suspicious of traditions that purportedly allow us to do so. The result is that even if their claims are true—if it _is_ somehow possible to realize these truths definitively, and moreover, our doing so matters in ways that we can scarcely comprehend—our rationally-based culture is presently cut off from realizing it.

Therefore, I think it is imperative for those who claim to have such knowledge to communicate not only the insights themselves, but more importantly _how_ such knowledge could even be possible, in ways that our culture can digest and integrate into its frameworks. Such communication may have a vital role to play in the survival of our species.

This piece is an attempt at such communication. While I cannot _prove_ that such knowledge is possible, I hope to achieve the more modest goal of providing intuition for why it may not be *im*possible in the way it first appears.

The key insight is this: our beliefs about the nature of reality hinge on a cognitive illusion that is _extremely_ difficult to penetrate under normal circumstances. Moreover, what happens when we _do_ penetrate it is impossible to imagine or communicate, because it operates below the layers of mind that support those functions. Therefore, when we hear descriptions of what "the other side" is like, we cannot help but couch it in our own illusory worldview, from which those descriptions can only sound like nonsense. Moreover, we assume that the other person must be doing the same. This results in a deadlock that can only be resolved by penetrating that illusion to some degree ourselves.

To illustrate the illusion, try and estimate the likelihood that the following scenarios are true:

* You are living in a simulation.
* Reality popped into being, fully formed, only moments ago (with the appearance of a real past, false memories, etc.)

Your first instinct is likely to be that they are profoundly unlikely


Part of what makes it so difficult to penetrate the illusion...

The short version:

A finite being is limited in what it can possibly know, but an infinite being has no such limitations. Roughly speaking, you are that infinite being — _Love_ — pretending to be limited. But there's still one "little" problem: no matter how convincing an experience you have of this "truth," wouldn't it be more rational to conclude that it was just the byproduct of a malfunctioning brain?

This suspicion is rooted in deeply held — but fundamentally unjustified — beliefs that you normally do not even recognize _as_ beliefs. When this fact is confronted in its fullness, your entire belief structure — and the supposed "reality" it was scaffolding — suddenly shatters. What remains is something astonishing that you've always known, but curiously overlooked.

As you stay immersed in this realization, you discover the folly of trying to explain what is unmistakably here in terms of fundamentally unjustifiable constructs like "time" and "space." As this funny habit subsides, you finally see "this" on its own terms. The closest English word is "miraculous," both because of its emotional impact and because everything that could conceivably _explain_ it is clearly perceived to be "downstream" from it.

> _The intellect is the bouncer of the heart_ -- Bernardo Kastrup, idealist philosopher.

A key question is this: what kind of experience could a person possibly have that would make them prefer the "mystical" interpretation to the mundane one—that whatever they experienced is merely the byproduct of a malfunctioning brain? Is it simply that the sheer intensity of the experience overwhelms the rational centers? No. Something much more interesting is going on: the practitioner perceives clearly that it is his _usual_ view of reality that is unjustifiable. This requires some explanation.

Consider the hypothesis that you are living in a simulation. How likely is it to be true? If your reality behaves just as a real one would, it is impossible to meaningfully estimate those odds without making assumptions about the "base reality"—which are by their very nature untestable. This means we cannot call it "likely" or "unlikely."

This applies not only to the simulation hypothesis, but also to countless other radically skeptical scenarios. For example, it is not possible to estimate the odds that reality sprang into being, fully formed, just moments ago. In other words, it is not "likely" that the past really happened.

_All_ of our beliefs are fundamentally unjustified. These are not my original findings, but are well accepted in the literature. Yet understanding this doesn't generally provoke mystical realizations. Why not?

It's because your beliefs operate at a _much_ deeper layer of mind than your intellect. You may _think_ you know what it's like to realize that your beliefs are baseless, but the actual experience of it will shatter your mind—and with it, the constructed "reality" that it's been overlaying on what's actually here.

The short answer is that if you really _are_ God, then there is no logical prohibition on your knowing it. It is only finite beings that are limited in what they can know. But this argument is rarely compelling enough on its own.

The next step is to investigate the limits on what a finite being could possibly know. Those limits turn out to be _much_ tighter than we normally realize.

Consider: if you really _are_ an isolated being embedded in a fundamentally external reality, then nothing prevents a malicious entity from hijacking your mind and presenting you with a false reality. Therefore, you could never be certain about the nature of your reality. But it's actually much worse: you could never even estimate the _probability_ that you were being thus tricked, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality" (e.g., that it obeys the same physics as yours).

In other words, if you really are an individual being, then there's literally no way to be confident in your reality with _any certainty whatsoever_. This applies not only to the particular details of your reality, but also its foundations, such as the existence of time and space. Therefore, if you believe yourself to be such a being, then you are forced to admit that all your beliefs are based on nothing but _pure faith_.

The way this problem is normally addressed is to make the following argument: since it is logically impossible to know the truth, we are therefore justified in choosing whichever view seems most sensible — and the "most sensible" view just happens to be that we really are individual beings embedded in a physical reality. This argument is almost universally accepted, but it contains an egregious fallacy: it assumes that you are a limited being in order to arrive at a view in which you are one.

This blatant circularity turns out to be much more than a mere logical error. It is one manifestation of the fundamental mechanism that You — God — use to keep yourself asleep. A good analogy is nighttime dreams. "_What?! Why is there a green dragon in my living room? Oh, right, it's just Green Dragon Tuesday. Silly me._" Whenever your suspicions are triggered, a deeper layer of your mind provides whatever justification it needs to quell them. 

This is essentially the same process you use to convince yourself that _this_ reality is real, albeit at a _much_ more sophisticated level. The "You" that dreams this physical reality is not your brain — that being just one minuscule component of this reality[^brain-hallucination]. Nonetheless, it is essentially the same kind of process that one uses to become lucid in a nighttime dream that enables one to become lucid "out here": you need only become _radically honest_ about what you do and do not know


[^brain-hallucination]: This mistaken view has become fashionable in recent years. But if [your brain hallucinates reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyu7v7nWzfo), then "your brain" — as one component of that reality — is also a hallucination. Why trust a mere hallucination to explain anything? Alternatively, if this one piece of your hallucinated reality is real enough to explain other things, then why aren't all the other "hallucinations" equally real? In that case, why call them "hallucinations" at all? Or is _your brain_ somehow the one real thing? This profound confusion is again the same trick.

Let's start by looking into the nature of belief.

You seem to be an individual being at the mercy of a fundamentally external reality. But if that's true, then nothing could prevent a malicious entity from hijacking your mind and presenting you with a false reality. Therefore, you could never be certain about the nature of your reality. In fact, you could never even meaningfully estimate the _probability_ that you were being thus tricked, without relying on fundamentally untestable assumptions about the "base reality" (e.g., that it obeys the same physics as yours).

Therefore, if you really _are_ an individual being, then it is unjustifiable to have _any certainty whatsoever_ in the nature of your reality. There is a silver lining, however: since all views are equally unprovable, we are logically free to pick whichever we like best. In every moment, we are making such a choice—almost always the _same_ choice—without realizing it. This continual need to put a solid ground beneath your feet is exhausting in a way that is impossible to notice until you stop doing so.

This extends beyond our personal beliefs. Every scientific truth also has a giant asterisk hanging over it ("\* _assuming reality is really as it seems_"), but we have learned to ignore this caveat despite the fact that it is, in a precise sense, _completely and forever_ unjustified. And why shouldn't we ignore it? What other option do we really have?

Your entire apparent reality is a castle in the sky. _Nothing whatsoever_ undergirds it, nor ever could. This is not a mystical insight, but a purely rational one. What would happen if you were to suddenly perceive this truth, in its entirety, in a very direct way?

Your intuition may tell you that _nothing_ would happen, but this couldn't be further from the truth. It's a defense mechanism your mind uses to _prevent_ you from seeing it. So is the belief that you would go crazy.

In other words, if you really are an individual being, then _any confidence whatsoever_ in the nature of your reality is unjustified. And because we believe that we _are_ such beings, such knowledge seems impossible. However, this belief _itself_ is unjustified. It's part of the trick.

Consider the possibility that what you really are is the _self-aware ground of reality_, whose nature is to dance apparent "realities" into existence, and then live out seemingly-mundane lives from countless perspectives within these dreams. These dreams generally obey internally-consistent dynamics, which is what makes them so convincingly real and seemingly external.

If this is true, then nothing outside yourself could prevent you from "waking up" and ascertaining this fact with flawless certainty—there being nothing outside yourself in the first place. However, if such an "awakening" were any kind of _experience,_ then it could not provide the necessary certainty: how could you ever be sure that it, too, wasn't also some kind of trick?

Awakening is _not_ a particular experience, and this is what makes it so frustrating to try to communicate. Still, certain features _can_ be communicated.

First is the realization that that one's beliefs are unjustifiable. Not the _understanding_ (which is easy enough), but the _real-ization_.

Begin by becoming _radically skeptical_ about the world around you, down to the very nature of space, time, and consciousness. If you can **completely** forget everything you think you know about reality, and directly confront what is manifestly here and now, the "miraculous" aspect will begin to "pop." This fledgling recognition can be traced back Home, to the glory-beyond-glory that those poems gently remind us of...

```
So close you can't see it
So deep you can't fathom it
So simple you can't believe it
So good you can't accept it
-- Tibetan Buddhist saying

> *Idealism and materialism are both impossible to prove or disprove, of course — they’re unfalsifiable statements, which means there’s no neutral test that could weigh them against each other. The test, ultimately, has to be one of intuition, or “gut reaction.” Many people find that materialism makes more sense because, after all, everyone has the experience of interacting with an outside world and believing that’s really “out there.” On the other hand, it’s impossible for us to step “outside” our own minds, so how can we be so sure that there really is an “out there” at all?*
