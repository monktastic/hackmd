**Alex**: Hey Bob, let me ask you something. What are the odds that reality suddenly popped into being five minutes ago?

**Bob**: What a silly question! I'm nearly thirty years old.

**Alex**: It seems that way, doesn't it? But how do you know that your memories aren't implanted? Maybe reality started five minutes ago, with only the _appearance_ of a real past, including our memories and photographic "evidence."

**Bob**: Yes, yes, sure. Still, I put the odds at roughly zero. It may not be literally impossible, but it's close enough.

**Alex**: On what grounds?

**Bob**: We took physics together in college, Alex! Don't you remem... oh, I see. Sure, I can't _assume_ that my knowledge from the past is valid in order to _prove_ that the past actually happened. Still, Occam's Razor...

**Alex**: Which is justified based on evidence from...

**Bob**: Dammit, yes, the past. Okay, but I can start accumulating knowledge _now_, and...

**Alex**: Let me tighten the screws. How do you know reality didn't pop into being _five seconds ago?_

**Bob**: That's absurd! We've been having this very conversation for more than five se... DAMMIT! Or _have_ we?

**Alex**: Now you're getting the hang of it! I claim that reality popped into being... NOW.

**Bob**: And indeed, I cannot put a meaningful probability to the assertion that it did not. So your claim is not technically "unlikely." Still, it _feels_ insanely unlikely.

**Alex**: Indeed. But if that feeling isn't actually coming from reasoning, where is it coming from?

**Bob**: Presumably it's an emotion, evolved to help us deal with ...

**Alex**: Come now, don't blame it on a principle that you've freely admitted you have no reason to believe in the first place! Look deeper!

**Bob**: I just don't see the point. Both stories are internally consistent: that time works the way we normally assume, and that it's "always" "now." At least the former seems useful!

**Alex**: Why do you say the latter isn't useful?

**Bob**: Because believing it doesn't seem to change anything!

**Alex**: How do you know? Have you ever really believed it?

**Bob**: Well not _really._ It's just so obviously false.

**Alex**:
