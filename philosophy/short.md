This world is miraculous, in a sense that transcends all belief systems—religious, scientific, or otherwise. This fact can be perceived directly and concretely, and our doing so may play a vital role in solving the converging crises of our day. Although we do not realize it, it is our (mis-)perception of reality as mundane and essentially lifeless that drives our ennui and enables us to treat the world (and each other) with the profound contempt that we do.

People may _want_ to believe that reality is miraculous, and even try to live _as though_ it were, but lacking a cultural framework that would allow this idea to be anything more than mere poetry or metaphor, 

our modern worldview provides no way for this to be anything more than poetry or metaphor. While we each occasionally catch glimpses of the sense in which it _is_ more, our desire to be sophisticated prevents those moments from taking root in a way that could transform us, both at the individual and societal levels.

I believe it is crucial to rescue it from the jaws of superstition. There is something very much worth seeing here. It would be a tremendous shame if our civilization failed to discover it because we were too "sophisticated" to bother looking.

> _When I've asked shamans about the sickness of the west, they say: "It's quite simple: you have severed your connection with spirit. Unless you reconnect with spirit and do so soon, you're going to bring the whole house of cards down around your heads and ours."_ — Graham Hancock

You seem to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space. Yet if this is true, the [problem of skepticism](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from knowing it with literally any certainty whatsoever. For example, not only can you not prove whether this is a simulation; you cannot even meaningfully calculate the _probability_ that it is—at least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about whatever is _outside_ your reality. Similarly, you cannot call it "likely" that the past really happened.

There is exactly one thing you _can_ be certain of, and the simplest way to put it is this: that _something seems to be happening._ You think you know what it is and what's causing it—a world "out there" and a consciousness "in here"—but in a specific sense, you have _no reason whatsoever_ to take that belief seriously.

The key is to see this clearly. No matter how flawlessly compelling an explanation you are given for this _sheer fact of seeming_, you shouldn't trust it in the slightest.

You seem to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space. Yet if this is true, the [problem of skepticism](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from knowing it with literally any certainty whatsoever. For example, not only can you not prove whether this is a simulation; you cannot even meaningfully calculate the _probability_ that it is—at least, without resorting to fundamentally untestable assumptions about whatever is _outside_ your reality. Similarly, you cannot call it "likely" that the past really happened.

There are several ways you might deal with this bizarre fact. The first is to notice that it doesn't matter: if there is no way to tell the difference, then in some sense, there _isn't_ one. While this reasoning is impeccable, it is actually a form of misdirection: _nothing to see here, move along!_ There is actually quite a lot to see, but doing so requires refusing your mind's clever pacifiers.

Consider: given that there are an infinite number of possible explanations for your present experience, and no rational way to assign odds to them, why do you still _feel_ so utterly confident in the "default view"? Try to answer this question without _presupposing_ that view (e.g., "well the past really _did_ happen, and it's evolutionarily advantageous to know this"). Whatever that answer might be, it must somehow lie entirely in the present—and it does.

There's something your mind is doing _right now_—the only time there actually is—to dissuade you from looking too carefully at where your misplaced certainty originates; a kind of "[_pay no attention to the man behind the curtain_](https://youtu.be/YWyCCJ6B2WE?t=25)." It is doing this out of pure benevolence — because if you were to stare directly into what your reality is like _prior_ to your assumptions about it, without being adequately prepared, well... to say that it would overwhelm you is a comical understatement.

It is often communicated in delicately understated tones:

> *So close you can't see it <br/>
> So deep you can't fathom it <br/>
> So simple you can't believe it <br/>
> So good you can't accept it* <br/>
-- Tibetan Buddhist saying

But I might as well go "full woo" and put it in explicit language.

What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite Love; the force that gave birth to the stars. In each moment, you dream countless realities into apparent existence, and then birth yourself into each of them from innumerable perspectives, so that you may experience yourself "from the outside." Such a perspective is where "you" find yourself now—but what You ultimately are is the very self-aware fabric from which all such dreams are woven.

The first question you will have—and the hardest to explain—is why this isn't subject to the problem of skepticism. No matter how compelling an experience it might be, why take it seriously?

The short answer is that it is not "an experience" from which you need to infer anything. It is not something happening _to_ you, which you need to interpret—as you interpret your experience now. But you don't realize that you _are_ interpreting your experience now, and so you cannot fathom what it would mean to know something in an entirely immediate (that is, unmediated) way.

There are a few analogies which may help, but ultimately it is only your deep remembrance that it is actually so that can convince you to (re)discover it.

All of your beliefs hinge on assumptions about the nature of reality — in particular, that you are an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of time and space — that seem too obvious to question, but are actually impossible to confirm with literally _any degree of certainty whatsoever_, thanks to the [_problem of skepticism_](radical-skepticism.md). Did the past really happen? Not only can you not _prove_ that it did; you cannot even meaningfully call it "likely."

The only thing you know with any certainty is that _something seems to be happening_ — and you can know it with _flawless_ certainty. Look around and confirm this. You believe you know what's causing it — a world "out there" and consciousness "in here," produced by a brain — but that belief is entirely unjustified. The only defensible position is agnosticism.

If you manage to achieve genuine agnosticism — which is harder than it sounds, but entirely doable — something _very surprising_ happens, to put it mildly. You discover that the reason you couldn't prove that time and space is because they _don't_. You were _imagining_ them. Not "you" as in the time-bound, localized individual being you normally take yourself to be, but a You that is somehow the very essence of reality; that which dreams it all into seeming existence.

From where you sit now, this may sound ridiculous. Even if it _were_ true, how could a human being ever know it? And even if you _thought_ you did, how could you be sure?

But you are _not_ ultimately a human being. What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite Love; that from which all realities are made. As the very ground of existence, nothing could prevent you from knowing this in a direct, immediate, non-inferential way.

Everything else you know is inferential in nature (and moreover, inferred using unjustifiable assumptions), so there are no good analogies for this kind of knowledge. It is entirely self-validating in the same way as your present certainty that _something seems to be happening_ — and for essentially the same reason.
