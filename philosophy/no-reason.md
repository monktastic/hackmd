_There is no evidence that brains actually exist._ What on Earth could such a bizarre statement mean?

Suppose I have a coin that I am hiding from you, and it is your job to guess what kind of coin it is. Now suppose I tell you that it has a US president on one side. Is this evidence that the coin is a (US) nickel? In one sense, yes: it helps rule out all non-US currencies. On the other hand, it is _equally_ good evidence that the coin is a US penny. Therefore it would not count as evidence _between_ those two choices.

On the other hand, let's say you already know that the coin is either a nickel or penny. Now suppose I tell you that I flipped the coin and it landed on its edge. Although this is a very unlikely outcome for _any_ coin, it is much more likely for the (wider) nickel than for the penny. Therefore, this _would_ count as evidence for being a nickel (vs a penny)[^Bayesian].

Therefore, whether some piece of data counts as "evidence" for a particular hypothesis depends on what other hypotheses you are choosing between.


[^Bayesian]: If you can quantify the relative probabilities of the two coins landing on an edge, then this tells you how much you should bias your guess toward one side or the other.  This is the essence of [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).
