If you haven't already [read](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html) or [watched](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI) Andy Weir's incredible short story The Egg, I strongly recommend doing so now, because there are spoilers up ahead.

---

Why do stories like The Egg provoke such visceral reactions in us? Some highly-upvoted comments from YouTube:

> I have no idea why, but I cried so hard watching this. Absolutely incredible.

> This has had such a strong impact on my values and identity. I feel the connection, I feel less lonely.

> I think it’s an absolutely beautiful idea to see everyone on earth as yourself. It brings understanding, empathy and equity to a whole other level.

The story is actually _true_ --- or rather, about as close to the truth as words can capture. It's not presenting just another idea, but evoking a deep memory of something you once knew but somehow forgot.

Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh communicates essentially the same truth with heartbreaking beauty in his [poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem/) _Call Me By My True Names_ (which I suggest you read in its entirety):

> _I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,  
> my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.  
> And I am the arms merchant,  
> selling deadly weapons to Uganda._
>
> _I am the twelve-year-old girl,  
> refugee on a small boat,  
> who throws herself into the ocean  
> after being raped by a sea pirate.  
> And I am the pirate,  
> my heart not yet capable  
> of seeing and loving._
>
> _I am a member of the politburo,  
> with plenty of power in my hands.  
> And I am the man who has to pay  
> his “debt of blood” to my people  
> dying slowly in a forced-labor camp._

Lest you think this is just metaphor, here's Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner (emphasis mine):

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, **but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.**
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.

I cannot claim to have the same degree of realization as these people, but even at my level, several things are manifestly clear. I cannot prove them to you, but perhaps they will trigger a certain primal recognition.

People only cause harm when they have lost contact with their true nature. This is an extremely painful state to be in, whether they are self-reflectively aware of that pain or not. Being cruel to them just pushes them further into their profound delusion. We are causing this harm because _we_ are lost.

When we feel self-righteous toward "bad people," what's actually happening is that we secretly _want_ them to drown in their delusion --- and our resulting behavior helps them drown. This generally occurs through causal mechanisms that are very hard to perceive. We cleverly make it _look_ like we're doing unmitigated good, even as we commit evil --- ultimately the very _same_ evil that we viciously blame our target for. We do this to maintain our self-image as "good people."

We only try to maintain this self-image because we cannot perceive our _absolute_ goodness. Part of us knows that it's somewhere down there, but because we cannot access it, we have to settle for _relative_ goodness. This requires a steady supply of _bad people_ who we can perpetually feel superior to. The whole world is lost in this game of pushing each other down, and it is killing us.

There is no escape from this cycle of suffering that doesn't involve seeing your true nature as unconditional Love --- and therefore also seeing it in everyone and everything else.

We also cannot perceive the profound sacredness in our environment. Instead, we see it as a mundane collection of "resources" that exist only to plunder. And we _need_ to plunder it, to continually distract ourselves from the profound hollowness that we feel deep inside --- the result of not perceiving the infinite plenitude that is our very nature. As each distraction fails to satisfy, we accelerate the development of ever-shinier distractions, consuming the "resources" at an accelerating rate.

There are many clever ideas on how to "save the world," but ultimately none can be truly successful without our waking up to what is closer than our own noses.
