How would you behave if you knew that everyone else was you in disguise?

You would never treat them with contempt, because you would perceive that at the very deepest level, they genuinely want to be better—and that by insisting otherwise, you are driving them further from that possibility. The only way to get them closer (to what you _both_ want) is through _love_—even if it must be [tough love](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dalai-gun/).

Alas, part of you _does_ know that they are you—and it _wants_ to push them down, so that they seem increasingly unlike you. This way, you will never have to consciously discover that they are you, and thereby be forced to confront the insanity of your behavior.

But "never" is a lie: one day—in this lifetime or a future one—you _will_ have to confront it. You will be shown that you somehow _always_ knew, and yet made the decision to pretend otherwise. _Why, why, why?_

Everyone else is doing exactly the same thing—darkening the world and pretending it's righteous—which is why you feel compelled to treat them with contempt in the first place. Why don't these idiots _see?_ It is because _you_ don't—by which I mean, _I_ don't.

It will take as long to clean up this ridiculous mess as it took to create it. "We" might as well start now.

> I have no idea why, but I cried so hard watching this. Absolutely incredible.

> This has had such a strong impact on my values and identity. I feel the connection, I feel less lonely.

> I think it’s an absolutely beautiful idea [...]. It brings understanding, empathy and equity to a whole other level.


A section from Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh's [poem](https://plumvillage.org/articles/please-call-me-by-my-true-names-song-poem/) _Call Me By My True Names_:

> _I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones,  
> my legs as thin as bamboo sticks.  
> And I am the arms merchant,  
> selling deadly weapons to Uganda._
>
> _I am the twelve-year-old girl,  
> refugee on a small boat,  
> who throws herself into the ocean  
> after being raped by a sea pirate.  
> And I am the pirate,  
> my heart not yet capable  
> of seeing and loving._
>
> _I am a member of the politburo,  
> with plenty of power in my hands.  
> And I am the man who has to pay  
> his “debt of blood” to my people  
> dying slowly in a forced-labor camp._

Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner (emphasis mine):

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I am them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.

> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.

Some guy on mushrooms:

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***

> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*
