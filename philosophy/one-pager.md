# Beyond the mind

At some level, we can sense that we do not actually know what reality _is._ Is it a simulation? A dream? Something else? If you are completely honest with yourself, you will discover that the only reasonable relationship with reality is one of _radical agnosticism._ In other words, you just cannot know, even a little bit.

Although we may not realize it, this fact terrifies us deeply. We avoid this fear by confidently _pretending_ to know. But something astonishing happens when we drop this pretense completely. It is an experience that reveals the ultimate source of all religious impulse, and is very much worth seeing—whether one is devoutly religious, anti-religious, or anywhere in-between.

The practice is very simple: sit and deeply accept that you cannot know what reality is. As you do this, you will begin to realize that you know exactly one thing: that _something seems to be happening._ Fully immerse your attention there, in _that-which-seems-to-be-happening_.

Two pointers seem to help here. First, realize that you do not even know if anything has happened _before_ this exact moment. You don't know whether you existed, or the universe existed, even a moment ago. Second, notice how it feels like there is "someone in here" experiencing "something out there." As your mind relaxes, even this distinction begins to fall apart. As it does, it feels increasingly like there is "something experiencing itself" — though this should not be turned into a belief, either. It is as though reality is awakening to itself.

The process seems to happen very slowly for some people, and very quickly for others. Either way, do not judge it. But eventually, there will come a moment that shatters the mind and melts the heart. You discover that you have been overlooking something _infinitely precious_ that is closer than your very nose. It is as though you are coming Home to a place you never truly left—and never _could_ leave. Your attempts to hide from your fear were actually making you hide from that which you desire most. There is no way to describe it, but _Love_ comes close.

Alas, this visit Home is generally brief. When you "come back," you will hold your beliefs much more lightly. There was never a reason to hold them so strongly in the first place. You see that being back Home is all that anybody ever wanted; all they ever _could_ want—and your only purpose here is to help us all get back. Not by raving about some mystical experience you had, or preaching your newfound gospel, but simply by being the best, most Loving "human being" you can possibly be. And maybe sharing your own pointers back Home, in case anyone asks :)

We cannot know reality, but reality can know itself. All we have to do is get out of the way.
