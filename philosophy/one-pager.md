This world is radically alive and infinitely precious, in a sense that our modern worldview is unable to fully accommodate. This prevents us from perceiving and living these truths, which is the root cause of our converging planetary crises. Therefore, I believe it is urgent to communicate _how_ and _why_ they can be perceived using methods that adhere to the consensus view—though their results certainly transcend it.

The [problem of skepticism](radical-skepticism.md) prevents you from inferring the nature of your reality with literally _any confidence whatsoever._ For example, you cannot put odds on whether this is a simulation, or on whether the past really happened. The only thing you know with _any_ certainty is that _something seems to be happening right now_—and you can know this with _flawless_ certainty.

Therefore, the most honest thing you can possibly do is to immerse your attention fully in _that-which-seems-to-be-happening_, while deeply releasing the pretense that you have _any idea_ what it is or what's causing it. You don't even know that you've experienced anything _before_ this very moment.

If you do this very precisely and sincerely, something truly astonishing—yet curiously familiar—will eventually happen. You will discover _why_ you couldn't prove that space or time are real: they aren't. You were _imagining_ them. What exists "prior" to that imagination is paradoxical and impossible to describe, and my attempt to do so will peg your "woo" meter:

What you most fundamentally are is pure, infinite Love. So is everyone and everything else—and you _are_ them. You are _all_ of it, but have forgotten this. Your sacred mission is to wake Yourself up through your Love. As the self-aware _ground of being_, you have equipped yourself with a direct way of confirming this that doesn't depend on inference. It lies entirely beyond the problem of skepticism, in a concrete way.

A deep part of you suspects this, even if your mind tells you it's nonsense. You don't have to choose between these beliefs. If you inquire with radical honesty, the truth cannot help but reveal itself in "time." The alternative is to go back to sleep. All this requires is to pretend you have any idea what is going on.
