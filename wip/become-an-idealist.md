# How to become an idealist

What is it that determines whether a person becomes a materialist, idealist, or something else? We like to think that we simply weigh the evidence and choose the option that makes the most sense — and that we are all taking approximately the same evidence into consideration — but there is an important aspect that is often overlooked.

To get a taste of it, consider how debates between the materialist and idealist camps often proceed: the latter take consciousness as a given

Conversations between materialists (M) and idealists (I) often go something like this:

I: Matter and consciousness are nothing alike. There is no way for the former to produce the latter.

M: You are giving up too soon. There are plenty of examples in science where counterintuitive things were found to have reasonable explanations.

I: I am not giving up too soon; you are failing to see what I am trying to show you.

From here, it goes in circles.
