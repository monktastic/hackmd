You _seem_ to be an individual being navigating a fundamentally external world of space and time. But if that is true, then the _problem of skepticism_ prevents you from confirming it — or anything else — with literally any degree of certainty whatsoever. For example, you technically have no reason to believe that the past really happened. Ponder this carefully until it begins to weird you out.

There are two ways to deal with this weirdness. The first is to "logic it away": if we truly cannot know which view of reality is correct, then we are free to choose whichever we like best. In that case, why not just pick our default view? Problem solved.

The other option is to chase the rabbit down the hole. Ask yourself: what _can_ I be certain of? You will discover that the _only_ thing you can be certain of is that _something seems to be happening._ Then, simply immerse your attention fully in _that-which-seems-to-be-happening_ while withdrawing it from your (provably unjustifiable) beliefs about what it _is_ or what is _causing_ it.

This is the most radically honest thing you could possibly do. It is (much) easier said than done, but if executed perfectly, something astonishing happens: you discover precisely where the idea of "God" comes from. Why would such a thing happen, and why would anyone trust it even if it did? This is nearly impossible to answer, but we'll offer some hints.

Suppose that what you most fundamentally are is the very ground of existence, taking the _shape_ of an apparent physical reality. You birth yourself into this (and numerous other) reality(ies) from countless perspectives, and one such perspective is where you find yourself now.

As the very ground of reality, the _problem of skepticism_ does not bind you. Nothing logically prevents you from giving yourself a "backdoor" by which you can decisively know the truth of your own nature, without having to rely on apparent evidence and inference like an individual being would.

The workings of this "backdoor" are impossible to communicate from within the confines of this apparent reality, but they can be known by You directly, in a way that is unmistakably distinct from how individual beings supposedly "know" things.

This is what all the sages and mystics have been trying to communicate. If it seems unlikely, just remember this: even _if_ the standard view of physical reality were correct, it would be logically unjustified to have any confidence in it whatsoever. On the other hand, if the above is true, then nothing prevents you from confirming it with flawless certainty. For that reason alone it is worth investigating. I promise you won't be disappointed.
