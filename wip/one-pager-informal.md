# Awakening through skepticism

Spiritual awakening occurs when you realize that you have literally _no idea_ what is causing your present experience. 

This probably sounds absurd: of course you have _some_ idea. For example, photons hit your retina, get transduced into signals that arrive in the brain, and you see, right? But consider: what are the odds that brains exist in the first place?

This may seem a strange question, but if you've ever thought about the [problem of skepticism](/philosophy/radical-skepticism.md), you know that things aren't as simple as they appear. For all you know, reality is a dream or simulation—and it's impossible to assign meaningful odds to these possibilities. We cannot know _in the slightest._

The usual solution to this conundrum goes as follows: if we really cannot distinguish between such possibilities, then we are logically free to choose whichever we like—in which case, why not trust in physical reality? Whether or not brains "really" exist, we are therefore justified in behaving _as if_ they do.

This is a "red pill, blue pill" moment. If you trust the above reasoning, you will not go any further. Everything will return to normal. On the other hand, can you sense that (possibly small) part of you that feels unsettled when you realize that you _really don't know_? If you chase that rabbit down the hole, something astonishing happens—but it requires great precision to do this without getting further lost in the maze of your mind.

The only thing you know for sure is that _something seems to be happening._ The "trick" is to stare directly into this completely undeniable "something" while deeply releasing all pretense of having any clue about _what it is_ or _what's causing it_. This is the most radically honest thing you could possibly do, and the only way to be sure that you're not leading yourself toward a particular conclusion. 

If you do this, you will soon begin to feel a childlike reverence, awe, wonder, and joy. If you let this growing realization gather momentum without aborting it with your "knowledge" and cleverness, it will eventually trigger a breakthrough. You will _awaken._ While you may not use "spiritual language" to describe it, you will be directly perceiving the source of all genuine religious impulse; that which the mystics know as God.

It turns out you are presently engulfed in a miracle[miracle] _beyond your wildest imagination_, and the only thing preventing you from seeing it is the misplaced confidence that you have the _slightest clue_ what's responsible for the glory unfolding before you.

What if you don't?

[^miracle]: Some people will bristle at the word "miracle": after all, just because we don't (and provably _can't_) know the cause of something certainly doesn't mean it doesn't _have_ a cause. This part is tricky to communicate. As an apparently individual being navigating a fundamentally external reality, you rely on reasoning and evidence to _infer_ the nature of your reality. But what if what you most fundamentally are is the self-aware _ground of reality_ itself? Might you have access to a mode of knowledge that transcends inference, and allows you to discern the Truth in an unmediated and self-validating way? It's worth finding out.
