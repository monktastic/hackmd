The converging planetary crises of our time are not incidental byproducts of an otherwise-sound civilizational philosophy; they are its inevitable result.

Unfortunately, this fact is extremely difficult to demonstrate through the tools that this philosophy recognizes as valid. Yet it is this very inability to accommodate subtler tools that is the seed of its inevitable failure in the first place.

Jung spoke of our _shadow_; those aspects of our personality that we are willfully blind to. As such, they cannot be pointed out by others directly. Any such attempt will be deflected by our subconscious, rendering us unable to look in the indicated direction. The same is true of the holes in our present philosophy.

Everyone has heard that "the map is not the territory." Yet few seem to realize that our entire civilization is built on this conflation.

Even the most staunch materialist ought to be able to admit that our reality is not "made of" matter; that matter is the map and not the territory. "Matter" is our way of making sense of a firsthand experience that itself cannot be captured in words or concepts.

Modern civilization focuses entirely on that map and discards the territory; the only thing we actually care about. This territory, being fundamentally ineffable, literally cannot _be_ measured. This is not a technological problem.

(If you find yourself envisioning technological solutions that _can_ "measure" our "firsthand experience," then you are engaging in exactly the conflation I warned about. You are not looking at where the finger is pointing.)

When one actually stares the territory full in the face for the first time (and this is, paradoxically, harder than it seems, given that it's all there really is), one sees the comical futility of trying to optimize it by shuffling around the map â€” that is, matter.

The more intensely we pursue this mirage, the more intense the side effects. Climate catastrophe and ecological collapse are the inevitable results of trying to coerce reality into our limited map. They are not pesky problems that more cleverness will solve. They reek of death precisely because we mistakenly perceive this world _as_ fundamentally lifeless.

Unfortunately, the alternative philosophy is hard to describe using language that doesn't trigger a mind steeped in this conflation. But we will try anyway.

All the good that ever happened in the world ultimately came from _love_. Matter is only the (apparent) medium by which it manifests. Technology isn't the problem (and indeed will likely form a large part of the solution). Lack of love for the territory is. Until that is restored, we can expect things to get worse, no matter how much cleverness is employed.
