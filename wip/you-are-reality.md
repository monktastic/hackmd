# Awakening through skepticism

You've heard the idea that we may be living in a simulation, but what are the odds that it is true? The answer depends entirely on assumptions you make about the "base reality"—the one that is supposedly simulating ours. For example, does it follow the same physics as ours, or more exotic laws? Does it contain sentient beings? Are they nice or nasty? You can answer such questions however you like, and thereby arrive at any probability you like. Yet there is no way to _justify_ your answers, rendering the whole exercise pointless.

This applies not only to the _simulation hypothesis_, but countless other strange possibilities. Is this a dream? Did all of reality suddenly pop into being, fully formed, just five minutes ago—with only the _appearance_ of a real past (including false memories)? Or does physical reality work exactly the way we've been taught? The only honest answer is "[I don't know](/philosophy/radical-skepticism.md)."

Yet something deep within us is completely certain that it _does_ know. Can you feel that?

One way to describe spiritual awakening is that it's the first time you realize—not just understand, but _realize_—that you have absolutely no idea what any of this is.

When that happens, you finally see "this"—life—for the very first time. Up until that point, you are always subtly looking _away_ from it, because you are taking it for granted. In each moment, there is an underlying feeling of "what's the big deal? I can explain all of this. And anyway, I've been looking at it for decades, so why bother looking too carefully right now?" But _have_ you been seeing it for decades? Or did reality suddenly pop into being just _now_?

What's so "spiritual" about this realization? This is tricky to describe.

As an individual being, everything you know—or _think_ you know—is derived by inference. As we saw, such inference is inherently unreliable: after all, there is a whole world _outside_ yourself that could be fooling you in any number of ways. But what if you are not really an individual? What if that is an illusion, and what you _actually_ are is the entirety of reality, dreaming itself into countless perspectives? Is it possible that the Whole can confirm its own condition in a way that no individual being ever could?

What would such a "confirmation" be like? How could you ever be sure that it, too, wasn't just a trick?

This question has a precise answer. Alas, it is only accessible during _awakening_—and it cannot be communicated in any way from _within_ this dream that we take to be reality.

It turns out you are presently engulfed in a miracle _beyond your wildest imagination_, and the only thing preventing you from seeing it is the misplaced confidence that you have the _slightest clue_ what's responsible for the glory unfolding before you.

What if you don't?
