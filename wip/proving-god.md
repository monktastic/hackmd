How do we ascertain the nature of reality? Normally, we _infer_ it through evidence and reasoning. But this is an inherently fallible process: for all we know, this reality is a simulation, and all the "evidence" is fabricated. There's no way to even estimate the _odds_ that we are being fooled in such a way -- at least, not without resorting to assumptions that are themselves impossible to verify. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the nature of reality with literally _any_ degree of certainty by relying on evidence and reason alone.

This is relatively easy to understand, but remarkably difficult to _grok_. Instead of making the effort to grok it, most people take the easy way out: "well then, I guess the problem doesn't matter, and I can go back to my usual beliefs." But something genuinely astonishing happens if you manage to grok it.

You discover that you've never actually looked at what's right here in front of you, because you were too busy looking at what you _thought_ was here. Once you see clearly that your ideas have literally no basis, you will finally _look_ for the very first time.

What you see is _infinitely glorious_. It is what you always wanted, but never knew you were searching for. It is the authentic source of all religion. Each one of us can taste it to some degree or another, whether we've consciously recognized it or not, and it is what inspires our reverence for this miraculous "reality."

That glimpse may last for only a split second, but when you return, something fundamental will have shifted: you will understand exactly what is meant by "the map is not the territory." You will no longer take models of reality _literally._ You may still say things like "my brain is causing my present experience," but you will perceive directly why such utterances are "[not even wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong)." 

Alas, you will be completely unable to communicate this insight directly to others. If this frustrates you, perhaps it is because you haven't seen fully that there _are_ no "others."

I will leave you with this poem:

And this quote:

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
