There is an age-old debate about the nature of reality, and its relationship to consciousness. The most common view today is that reality is purely physical, and that consciousness is just a byproduct. But how could physical things give rise to something so seemingly non-physical? This is an open question, known as the Hard Problem of Consciousness. Some consider it to be the most perplexing question in all of science.

Another view is that consciousness is somehow the basis of reality, and what we call matter is somehow a manifestation of it. This is the view held by mystics across the ages.

In philosophy, these two views are known as materialism (or physicalism) and idealism.

Materialism is considered by most people to be the more rational choice, and idealism seems to be bizarre speculation. But what I want to share with you today is how a purely rational, intelligent, honest being might find themselves flipped over to this second perspective, after which it becomes nearly impossible to go back to the first.

This shift in perspective I'm talking about is called _awakening_ in some spiritual traditions. It is famously impossible to describe, and difficult to attain. So I won't be trying to induce it in you, but I will hint at what it is like and why it is worth attaining.

But first, let's take a step back and ask: why should this debate matter to regular people? To answer that question, let's look at a quote from a famous materialist, Richard Dawkins. He says:

> _The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference._

Many people find this view profoundly disheartening and grim. In fact, consider what the word "materialism" means to non-philosophers. It's about unhealthy attachment to material things. But if material things are all there is, then what could be wrong with that orientation? In this way, the materialist philosophy could be seen as the root cause of the climate crisis, our crisis of despair, and more. But if it's true, then we have a duty to believe it and work within its logic.

On the other hand, if idealism is true, then our place in reality isn't an accident. In fact, we don't have a place in reality; reality is more like a place within us. Don't worry, I'm not saying that you are the only conscious being — a view known as solipsism — I'm saying that each of us is more like a portal into the mind of an infinite being who you might think of as God. We are intimately connected in a way that isn't necessarily obvious from looking at physical instruments. When you see this firsthand, you cannot help but love and care for all of this infinitely magical reality.

Of course, materialists can also love reality. It's just that if you believe that your love is ultimately just particles randomly smashing into each other with pitiless indifference, then your love will always subconsciously be undermined, even though you may not notice it.

So, what makes this debate so difficult?

Some people say that consciousness is the one undeniable fact about reality. To many, this seems too obvious to question. On the other hand, how do you know that it isn't just an illusion being created by your brain? Okay, but for there to be an illusion, there must be a consciousness to which it is happening, right? Ah, but that's just what your brain _wants_ you to think! People have gone in circles in this way, reaching no consensus.

The problem is that we are using the word "consciousness" in subtly different ways.
