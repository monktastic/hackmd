It is said that the evil elites are playing us regular people off each other to take attention off of themselves. True as this may be, the rabbit hole goes much deeper. I will try to point it out.

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify it? This is willful ignorance; self-deception. In this state, you _know_ that what you're doing is wrong, but that wrongness is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection. It is a schism in the mind. When you see it clearly, you will know the secret mechanism behind _all the evil there ever was_.

This schism is caused by a parasite in the mind that alters your very perception of reality. One of its key tricks is make you perceive the existence of intrinsically bad people who deserve your contempt. Hating the "bad people" is how you know that you're good. You then behave in a way that you _know_ darkens the world, even as you believe you are "fixing" it.

A classic example is when we mock our political opponents. Somehow they don't just apologize and repent. They perceive _us_ as intrinsically bad, double down, and vow to return the favor. This recalcitrance vindicates our perception of them and justifies escalation—which was our hidden goal all along. But we told ourselves that we were "doing good," and we probably believed it.

We don't recognize this self-deception, but others can smell it a mile away—and it is _this_ that triggers their recalcitrance; _not the mockery itself_. Your self-deception draws their attention _away_ from theirs, and vice versa—thus strengthening both. It is a kind of "secret handshake" between your two parasites, and with enough sensitivity, you can learn to perceive it directly.

What your parasite hides from you is that those "bad people" are simply under the sway of their own parasite—and it is _this_ that is your enemy; not the people themselves. But you can only remove theirs to the degree that you are free of your own—or else your distorted perception will _ensure_ that you end up doing its bidding, even while you're convinced that you're not.

This is why the US is heading toward civil war, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. It is what leads to bitter divorces, where each party is convinced they are the exclusive victim / hero. The parasite invites us to escalate toward various kinds of Armageddon, in which we get to prove just how _good_ we are, once and for all. But its insidious effects are felt long before that.

Our parasites are working together, like a single distributed super-organism. In this way, human minds form a vast network by which this shadowy entity communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold. It is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that no one of us claims to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.

This is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that people fear is secretly running the world: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem, yet which nobody can see—and _we_ are its unwitting minions. 

Every time we feel malice, contempt, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding it. This behavior ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show—or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are ultimately just minions of our collective shadow. It is the ultimate puppeteer.

Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we vengefully string up, we secretly instruct reality to immediately fill their shoes. All that changes are the specifics of their evil. It is as though our left hand doesn't know what our right is doing. The system cannot change without us owning up to our individual complicity.

There was a news story where loggers in the Amazon tied an eight-year old girl to a tree and burned her alive to scare her tribe off the land. I'm sorry to evoke that image. Feel the absolute rage toward such evil. It is there to help you discover what can be done to ensure that this—and anything else like it—never happens again. The world is complex, and solutions are complex.

Now feel if there is contempt and malice mixed in. This is your parasite, and it oversimplifies the world: "loggers bad! smash!" It is secretly plotting a trajectory toward a darker world, but one in which you get to feel unequivocally righteous. This is what allows our military to carpet-bomb civilian areas where terrorists are hiding, thus "accidentally" bringing up a new generation of terrorists who we will then "unfortunately" have to nuke. _We were just fighting evil. How were we supposed to know?_

If you are now hating our military leaders, well, here's another chance to recognize your parasite.

Notice how hard it is to distinguish virtuous anger from malice. One is there to serve the world, and the other to serve your ego. In both cases, the solution may well include imprisoning or perhaps even harming the perpetrators. But if you choose the route of the parasite, you _will_ end up encouraging more evil somewhere, somehow, in some way that you will be unable to perceive.

But you _can_ learn to perceive it. It is not just a theory of mine. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see through your parasite, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

Following this, you understand the dictum to always be kind. It doesn't mean being nice. Kindness can be fierce, or potentially even violent, as the situation warrants. The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That's not very nice. But if it is not rooted in malice, it can certainly be kind.

Nailing down what kindness is, is the work of a lifetime. But it is the most fulfilling, and ultimately, most important, work any of us could ever do.

Your contempt exists only to bait people into becoming worse, so that you can escalate to malice and beyond.

- Evil's greatest trick is to convince you that it doesn't exist in your own mind; or, if it does, that it exists to fight the evil "out there."
- Thus convinced of your own moral infallibility, you allow yourself to behave in ways that you would rightfully condemn in others.
- Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify your behavior? Of course you have; you're human.
- This is willful ignorance; it's a kind of self-deception.
- In this state, part of you knows exactly what you're doing, but that knowledge is cleverly hidden from conscious self-reflection.
- It is a schism in the mind, and it is the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was.
- When you see someone misbehaving, it feels obvious that they know that they're doing wrong.
  - In a sense, this is true. 
  - But their self-deception is correspondingly stronger too, and so that knowledge is cleverly hidden from the aspect of their mind that would put an end to it, if only it knew.
  - You cannot simply shake or shame someone out of this state. If you try, you will just make things worse.
- But the real shocker is that part of you _wants_ to make things worse.


- You know that classic image of an angel and devil on your shoulder? It's not quite accurate.
  - The angel actually represents the deepest aspect of your mind, which knows right from wrong. It is intrinsic to you.
  - The devil is an extrinsic parasite, and it can be killed.
- It is this parasite that is responsible for your self-deception.
- Unlike the classic devil, it doesn't just whisper ideas in your ear; it actually alters your very perception of reality.
- It makes you look out and see a world that requires your contempt and malice to fix it.
  - Obviously not everyone deserves your contempt, but the bad people certainly do.
  - In fact, hating bad people is part of what it _means_ to be good.
- But what the parasite prevents you from seeing is that those bad people are simply under the sway of exactly the same parasite — and if you treat them with contempt, you will only strengthen it, in both yourself and them.
- Think about what happens when you yell at an idiot from the opposing political party. Do they meekly repent and change their wicked ways? No, they just perceive _you_ as bad and vow to return the favor.
  - But _why_ do they do this? The obvious answer is because they're bad and recalcitrant. But there's something much more insidious going on.
  - Part of you wants to egg people on, to prove just how bad they are, so that you could escalate your malice while coming out looking like the righteous one.
  - Of course, you can't admit to yourself that this is what you're secretly doing.
  - You don't see that you're being self-deceptive, but other people can smell it a mile away, even if only subconsciously.
  - They're not reacting to your shaming so much as to your hypocrisy. 
  - There are ways of shaming people that don't result in a downward spiral, but they cannot work if there's even a trace of contempt or self-righteousness.
  - Those feelings exist _only_ to help you find clever ways of baiting people into becoming worse, while hiding the fact that you're doing this.
- While under the sway of your parasite, you don't actually want a better world. You just think you do. What you secretly desire is a kind of Armageddon, in which you get to prove just how good you actually are. And every action you take will get you closer to that secret goal.
  - This is why the US is heading toward a civil war.
  - This is what leads to bitter divorces, where each party sees themselves as the exclusive victim / hero.
- It leads to all kinds of horrible outcomes in which nobody recognizes their own complicity. 
- We're all too busy blaming each other to notice that the real culprit is a sinister puppeteer that is secretly pulling all of our strings.

- My evil seeks yours out not to fight it, like it convincingly pretends, but to create more of itself under the guise of good.
- In this way, it behaves like a distributed organism...
- This organism leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.
- It is that archetypal evil conspiracy that people fear is running the world: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem, yet which nobody can see. And we are its unwitting minions.
- Every time we feel malice, contempt, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding this organism. This behavior ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show.
  - Or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are ultimately just minions of our collective shadow.
- Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we vengefully string up, we secretly instruct reality to fill their shoes; all that changes are the specifics of their evil. The system cannot change without us changing.
- You know how some people feel that the elites are playing us off each other?

- Your enemy isn't other people; it's the parasite in their minds.
- You can only remove their parasite in others to the degree that you are not under the sway of your own.
- Resolve the willful ignorance in your own mind. A good measure of this is how much you believe that your malice is there to help the world.
- It is said that if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention. Wise outrage is anger aimed at correcting injustice. The parasite adds in self-righteous indignation. How much of that do you still feel?
- Because otherwise you are just doing its bidding without realizing it.


- The only solution is compassion, but that word doesn't mean what you think it does.

Part 2: how would they behave
Part 3: how do you get there?

- This is why wise people encourage us to be compassionate to bad people. They're not telling us to be nice. Compassion can be as fierce or potentially even violent as the situation warrants.
  - The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back.

- Compassion, in this context, just means seeing reality clearly instead of through the lens of your parasite.

- From this perspective, it becomes obvious that the vast majority of "bad people" are acting that way because of pain that is hard to see, but that maybe you can help heal.

- And the ones that are beyond your ability to help... well, at least you're not feeding their malevolence with your own. You must still forcefully oppose them. But the absence of any trace of malice in your mind makes all the difference.

### Parasite deep dive
 
- The world gets a little bit darker, but you can blame it entirely on them. After all, you were just fighting evil, and how could that ever be wrong?
- But part of you secretly knew that this would happen.
  - Your parasite got you to behave in a way that you _knew_ would make the world darker, while simultaneously making you pretend _not_ to know.
  - You cannot sense your self-deception, but others are ridiculously sensitive to it. So they now perceive you as a bad person, who they must fight.
  - Both of you are now convinced that the other is intrinsically bad, and not just "infected by some parasite." And it was your parasites that got you to feel this way!
- Shaming people isn't intrinsically bad, but we do it in a way that secretly invites them to become worse, in order to justify our perception of them.
  - If this invite were out in the open, nobody would fall for it. For example, if you overreact, people might see you as crazy, and deserving of sympathy.
  - It is the very _secrecy_ of this invite; the utter hypocrisy of it; that telegraphs the true purpose, and all but forces them to accept our invitation.
- Contempt exists only as a way to bait people into becoming worse while pretending that we're doing good.

- But you can only see their parasite clearly once you have seen your own clearly.
- Otherwise, every action you take to fight evil will secretly be amplifying it.
  - If you feel the slightest trace of self-righteousness, you are under its control.
- When you are free of the parasite, you stop seeing people who need to be harmed, and start seeing people who need to be helped.
  - And this may be confusing but, sometimes that help must come in the form of harm.

- There is no point at which evil _feels_ wrong to the person doing it. It's only obvious from the outside.
- So if you think it's safe to be a tiny bit evil now, and that you'll stop before it becomes real evil, think again. You don't want to go down that road.

- People say that the elites are playing us off each other, to take the attention off of them.
  - And while this is probably true, the rabbit hole goes so much deeper.
  - The elites are, like us, under the sway of the evil organism.
