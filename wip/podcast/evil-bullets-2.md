Have you ever suspected that there's an evil conspiracy responsible for all the world's horrors? Well there kind of is, and it's much more insidious than you think. Buckle up.

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify it to avoid feeling bad? Of course you have; you're human. 

This is willful ignorance; self-deception. Try and recall what that state is like.
The deepest part of you isn't okay with what's happening, but your mind finds a clever way to hide that fact from you. This is exactly the trick that the "bad people" use to do what they do.

We are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. Deep down we know this, but our mind tries to hide it from us. We perceive the "bad people" as intrinsically defective, and thus _fundamentally_ different from us. We make a big show of hating them and treating them with contempt, as if to prove just how different we are.

Unfortunately, this backfires miserably, because it is self-deception. We don't recognize it as such, but other people can smell it from a mile away. This makes them perceive _us_ as intrinsically bad, and so they feel morally obligated to fight _our_ evil in return.

A classic example is when we mock our political opponents. Somehow they don't just apologize and repent. They double down and vow to return the favor. We act dismayed by this recalcitrance, but we secretly wanted this, because it proves how bad they are, which licenses us to visit even more righteous fury upon them.

Our secret goal is to provoke a kind of Armageddon, in which we can violently prove just how good we are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. It is what leads to bitter divorces, in which both sides feel like the exclusive victim / hero. This isn't by accident. Something within us _wants_ this to happen.

That "something" is a parasite embedded deep within our minds. It gets us to behave in ways that make the world worse, while making us feel righteous about doing so. It is impossible to overstate how clever this is. Any time you feel hostile toward the world or anyone in it, your parasite is generating a brilliant excuse for you to darken the world while feeling totally justified about it. Deep down, you know this is wrong, so you hide it even harder. The more evil you leak into the world, the less able you are to recognize it.

Your parasite knows that the "bad people" are caught in the same trap, and being nasty to them will simply ensnare them further. In this way, your parasite strengthens theirs. You may see this person as your enemy, but your parasites are secretly allied. This is why, as MLK said, "hate cannot drive out hate." It's not even _trying_ to! Your malice exists _only_ to strengthen other people's.

In this way, our parasites act like a single distributed super-organism, and our minds form the vast network by which it communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold. It is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.

This is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that people fear is secretly running the world: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem, yet which nobody can see—and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Except, again, it's not really unwitting. We just pretend not to see our role. 

Every time we feel malice, contempt, hatred, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding the beast. This behavior ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show—or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are ultimately also minions of our collective shadow.

Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we vengefully string up, we secretly instruct reality to immediately fill their shoes. All that changes are the specifics of their evil. It is as though our left hand doesn't know what our right is doing.

With enough sensitivity, this can all be perceived directly. It's not just a wild theory. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see it, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

This is impossible to communicate, but I'll try. You discover that you could _always_ perceive the deepest aspect of other people's minds; the part that only ever wants to be free of their parasite. But instead of helping it out, you gave it a knowing wink and shoved it further in. It is as though you were smothering its secret cries for help by pretending not to recognize them as such. This is every bit as sinister as it sounds. The only solace is that we never wanted to act this way, and we always have another chance to set things right.

Your enemy is not other people; it is the parasite within their minds. Yet it would be a mistake to run out and fight other parasites without doing some inner work first. Because to the degree that you are still under the sway of your own parasite, your distorted perception will _ensure_ that you will just be doing its evil bidding. You will end up encouraging more evil somewhere, somehow, in some way that you will be unable to perceive.

This is why our parasite keeps our attention fixated outward, on all the evil "out there" instead of what's happening in here. Because that way, we will avoid doing the one thing that could actually end it, and instead, end up strengthening it.

Now, to be fair, waiting til you are entirely free of your parasite to fight evil would be crazy, because the parasite is what the Buddhists know as "the ego," and freedom from it is enlightenment. Until then, the best I seem able to do is to stay powerfully alert to that tendency in myself that wants to perceive other people as intrinsically bad. Because the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.

With those blinders off, it is much easier to perceive the complexity in any given situation. The parasite oversimplifies: it sees "good guys" and "bad guys," and its brilliant plan is to "smash the bad guys." It makes us overlook the astonishing array of causes and conditions that led to their behavior, which would actually enable us to do something genuinely useful about it.

That's all compassion means. It's not about being nice. Compassion is simply the result of seeing clearly. From this perception, we may still have to take fierce or possibly even violent action.

The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That can be compassionate, if you're not acting from your parasite. In that case, you won't see a "bad person," and there won't be even a trace of malice or self-righteousness. Other people can subconsciously sense the purity of this motivation, and it makes all the difference in the world. It actually weakens their parasites and yours.

There's a lot more to be said about how to develop such compassion, and how to apply it in difficult situations. But I hope this gives a tiny glimpse of why it is the only thing that can save us from the demon that plagues us.
