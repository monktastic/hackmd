In 2008, while on a three-month meditation retreat in the Rockies, I realized something about the nature of evil shattered my world. I am far from the first to see it, but I want to put it in my own words, because I believe it holds the key to the very survival of our species.

Up until that point, I believed—as I think most people do—that the problems of the world were caused by bad people. Just look at the oil execs who knew about climate change decades ago, but suppressed that information to line their own pockets. Or our politicians who lie through their teeth to support unjust wars. If only we could be rid of such sociopaths, the rest of us good people would flourish.

But what I saw on retreat destroyed this idea. I saw, with unmistakable clarity, that I _am_ those bad people. The capacity for self-deception that enables their evil lives firmly within my own heart. And my unwillingness to admit this to myself allows that evil to stay alive.

_The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was to convince you that he doesn't exist within your own mind._

Evil is a parasite, and it is _insanely_ clever. It infects people's minds so perfectly that you can no longer even recognize them as being infected. Instead of perceiving an otherwise-decent person whose mind has become infected by evil, you simply see a bad person; someone who is intrinsically morally defective, unlike you. Think about your political opponents. Even if they weren't born evil, they clearly let themselves descend into it. Something you would never do.

Well, I've got bad news for you. To the degree that you believe that you are immune, it's an unmistakable sign that the darkness has _already_ colonized the deepest aspect of your mind. 

The very first symptom of infection is that you begin to perceive the world in terms of good and bad. You are clearly good. And since only a bad person is capable of sliding into the depths of evil, you don't have to fear that happening to you. Therefore, you can let your guard down. You don't need to be on alert for signs that you may be going down the wrong track. Behaviors that you once would have immediately recognized as malicious begin to look positively noble. That is how the infection spreads.

For example, what could possibly be wrong with mocking your political opponents? It's actually the very least you could do as a decent person. It's kind of your moral duty. I won't be able to convince you otherwise, but I want to suggest another perspective.

Part of you knows that this story is a sham—that all that will really be accomplished by being nasty to your enemies is the creation of more enmity in the world. It will not make them or anyone else a better person. In fact, it will make everyone a little worse. And this isn't just collateral damage of an otherwise noble mission; it's secretly orchestrated by your darkness. The darkness in you wants to create a worse world; one which it will really be justified in sinking its malevolent teeth into... in the name of good, of course.

It mustn't let you become aware of its true purpose. And it knows the inside of your mind far better than you do. So it knows exactly which strings to pull, so that not only do you stop perceiving the harm you're actually causing; you actually perceive it as an unalloyed good. And nobody will be able to convince you otherwise. If someone tries to convince you that mocking bad people is a sign of evil infecting your mind, well, _they_ must be stupid, crazy, or evil.

Even if you can see what I'm hinting at with this example, you might wonder why I'm making such a big deal about such minor misbehavior. The reason is that this is how the darkness tests the waters of your mind. If it can get you to write off this one thing as no big deal, then it knows how to lull you into complacency. Under the right circumstances, it can then get you to do far worse—and it is working to bring about those very circumstances, in which you will feel justified in being arbitrarily cruel.

This is an example of what Carl Jung called the shadow. We can perceive the self-deception operating in other people that enables them to do bad things without admitting it, but we can never see this process operating in our own minds. 

That is how political rivalry escalates into civil war, without anyone being consciously aware of their role in bringing it about. But it was architected by the darkness in all of our minds, working together, behind the scenes.

It is how evil people can do what they do without feeling remorse. In a very real sense, they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. One part of them absolutely does know, and that's the part that we can see. But another part thinks its doing something righteous, and that's the part that their darkness allows them to see. If you haven't seen clearly how your own darkness is keeping large aspects of your mind hidden from you, then it's impossible to understand the true origin of evil, and thus, to do anything helpful about it. Everything you do to fight evil will secretly be in its service.

It is also how humanity somehow managed to create economic and political systems that allow a small handful of greedy sociopaths to destroy our world despite there being billions of us good people who didn't want this to happen. Our darkness needed there to be easily-identifiable bad guys responsible for all the problems so that we don't have to confront our own misdeeds. So it architected a system in which that could happen. Such a system will continue to run the world for as long as we avoid owning up to our own contribution. It is completely inevitable.

To be clear, I am not blaming us _instead_ of them. But I have been forcibly shown with terrifying precision how every tiny act of unkindness that I've perpetrated on this world was secretly designed to create people that I could turn around and blame things on. It would be insane for me to see this and still harbor malice. Yet I often do. I am a complete hypocrite. So nothing in this talk should be misunderstood as suggesting that I am in any way better than anyone. But it would be crazy not to share what I was shown.

So far, from what I've said, being cruel to bad people is counterproductive, and in a sense, purposefully so. But being nice to them is even worse. So what is a decent person to do? Well, there is a third option.

To the degree that you gain insight into how evil has been able to colonize your mind, you begin to learn its tricks. You recognize it as a parasite. From this, you begin to recognize that parasite operating in others—including those who you previously saw as intrinsically bad. This enables you to employ the third option, which is compassion.

Compassion is the most misunderstood word in the English language. People think it means something like being nice, but that's just what the evil wants us to think. After all, being nice—that is, pleasant and agreeable—is clearly no solution to the big problems. So evil wants to convince us that this is what compassion means, because then we would write it off as useless. That is the trap we have fallen into as a civilization, and it is what allows evil to thrive unchecked. We have convinced ourselves that compassion is soft and weak, when it's actually the only thing that can evict the parasite of evil.

The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. There's nothing soft or weak about that. But how could that be compassionate?

Compassion is the realization that at the deepest level, all you really want is for everything to feel totally okay. And that this is what everyone else wants, too, despite obvious appearance to the contrary. But it's not enough to believe this. If you look at a Hitler and think oh, poor guy just wants to feel okay, well, that's not going to end well. It has to come from an authentic perception of the true nature of reality. Only then can it serve the purpose of defeating evil.

Reality is actually one seamless whole which you only appear to be separate from. This illusion of separateness is called the ego, and it is our normal mode of operation. But below that level, certain universal truths can be glimpsed.

In particular, you discover that the nature of mind is intrinsically compassionate. It's what we are. But we quickly forget this. That gives rise to the subtle fear that we may not be entirely good. This terrifies us, and instead of confronting the fear within, we project it outward, onto other people. In fact, the very perception of there being an external reality with distinct people is an illusion, but we won't go there today.

So we project our primordial fear onto other people, who we then perceive as evil. This necessitates that we vanquish them in order to prove our own goodness. Unfortunately, this just makes us feel even _more_ guilty, because deep down, we know that we're just harming fundamentally innocent people. This in turn forces us to project even harder, thus creating even more evil outside to defeat, ad infinitum. 

This cycle literally cannot end by destroying the evil out there. That can only intensify it. The only way to end this sordid game is to remember its origin, which was the primordial fear that we're not actually good. And the only way to quell that fear is to remember our true nature as compassion.

This story can be understood in several different ways. If you treat it as a process that unfolded in linear time, then it doesn't make a lot of sense. When was this supposed beginning in which you separated from your true nature? What about all the obvious evil that existed before your birth? And who was the first one to start projecting, thereby kicking off this fateful process?

But as I hinted at earlier, you are projecting the entire illusion of space and time.

This is why hurt people hurt people. When we are made to feel unworthy of love, it hurts so much that we can't bear to face it. How could a fundamentally decent person like me be made to feel this way? And why isn't anyone trying to help? What a cruel world. If the world won't give me the simple comfort that I need, well, who can blame me for taking it myself?

Meanwhile, the rest of us don't perceive a fundamentally decent person trying to get the love they desperately need, we simply perceive an evil person. And since we're such good people, it is our moral duty to remind them that they are not only unworthy of love, but deserving of our contempt. 

We tell ourselves that if we were in their shoes, we wouldn't be crying out for help by doing bad things. We would either pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, or else ask for help nicely, like a decent person. We even have evidence of this.

But the perception that compassion opens up lays waste to this self-serving nonsense. If you believe it, I will not be able to convince you otherwise. But you are not special. You do not have a magical good soul that bad people lack, that enables you to escape the maze of delusion that they find themselves trapped in. In fact, the belief that you are special is itself the most damning evidence that you are not. Because it is only when we ourselves are trapped in delusion that we are able to look down on others in this way instead of doing what we can to alleviate this delusion in the world.

Outrage is another such word. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention, right? Right! If outrage means anger directed at correcting an injustice. But we never leave it at that. Our evil usually hitches a ride.

So far I've been anthropomorphizing evil, but it's actually just a synonym for another word I used earlier: ego. That is, the simple perception that you are fundamentally separate from reality. And that misperception is completely innocent. It's definitely not a sin. But to the degree that you harbor it, you cannot help but induce it in others. You will see them as fundamentally different from you, and behave in ways that remind them of this. Some of them you will see as beneath you

In other words, you cannot help but spread evil. 


---

To put it another way: what you are is absolute goodness without an opposite. But you now seem to inhabit a world of duality, in which everything has an opposite. You're seeking your original goodness, but in here, good can't exist without bad. So the only way you can make yourself good is by injecting bad into the world somewhere. This is completely inevitable. You cannot make yourself good without making others bad. 

Think about how remorseful you feel when you realize that you've done something wrong. Also think about times when you've done something a little questionable that you wouldn't let others get away with.

Contempt is evil. I don't mean that it's extremely terrible, I mean that if you distill and distill and distill contempt, what you get is pure malevolence; the kind that sends shivers down your spine just to think about. It's on the same continuum. The presence of contempt in your mind is the presence of evil, and it works in a very clever way.

My evil lies dormant in most normal settings. But when I get triggered by another person's evil, mine gets called into action. That person may be my mortal enemy nominally, but beneath the surface, our evils are secretly allied. The two of us are going to behave in ways that make the world a darker place. But I am going to pretend that my malice is serving the noble goal of vanquishing his, and he is going to do the same.

In fact, I won't just be _pretending_ to do good. My evil knows the inside of my mind far better than I do. It will modify my very perception so that I will _know_ unequivocally that what I'm doing is virtuous, and I will have the evidence to prove it to anyone who dares question my motives.

If I'm not aware that I'm being manipulated like this—and I'm usually _not_—then I can become increasingly malicious without limit, while simultaneously becoming increasingly sure of my own righteousness. That's the trap that truly evil people have fallen into. We believe that we could never fall into it, because we would recognize the warning signs. But if you believe this, it only means that you haven't seen how terrifyingly clever evil can be in manipulating your perception of reality.

So far, I've been using the word evil, but another word for it is ego. You see, reality is one seamless whole, which you only _appear_ to be separate from. That illusion of separation is called the ego. It gives rise to the belief that other people are fundamentally different from you, which in turn compels you to divide the world into the good and bad, and then to feel contempt for the bad, and then all the rest we just described follows. It all begins with that simple, innocent, misperception.

So when I said that evil could be terrifyingly clever in altering your reality, it's not some external entity that's doing this. In a certain sense, it's you. Part of your own mind can manipulate your perception to enable you to do horrible things. And this aspect of your mind is ancient. That's why it knows you better than you know yourself. It is a big mistake to think that just because you're a normally decent person, that you would never fall for its traps. In fact, if you think that you're immune to its tricks, that's an unmistakable sign that you've already fallen for its oldest and most powerful one.

I saw how easy it would have been for me to become a Nazi. This shocked me, because I had spent my life sure that I was one of the good guys. But that was precisely the problem. 

You see, it all begins with the innocent idea that there are good and bad people. This is a misperception, as we shall see. And it's not so innocent. The bad people are those who we can be cruel to without feeling guilt.

They're not necessarily evil (yet), and I don't enjoy being cruel. But they certainly are morally defective, and if they cross the line, well, the kid gloves will have to come off. It's my moral duty as a good person. Until then, I will just treat them with contempt, to keep them in check. My political opponents come to mind.

But somehow, my contempt isn't keeping them in check. Instead, they're recalcitrant, and are now treating me with contempt. What's the matter with them? Can't they see that we're the good guys, and they're the bad guys? Of course they can't, because they're morally defective. All I can do is fight harder.

I'm shocked when civil war breaks out, and there are atrocities on both sides. But they brought this on themselves. If they had just listened, none of this would have happened. Now, we are left with no choice.

What I don't see is that this is the outcome I was secretly plotting when I invented the split between good and bad: an Armageddon with which to prove, once and for all, which side I was on. My contempt wasn't there to keep them in check, but to egg them on—and to remind myself that they're not fully human, so that I could do what I needed to when the time came.

What do I mean I invented the split? Well, it turns out that the nature of mind is intrinsically compassionate. We're all fundamentally the same in that way. Where we differ is how far we are from remembering it; how deluded we are. The further one is, the more evil they appear, but it's a continuum. There's no actual dividing line, just the one I create.

I may not even know where that line is, or who's on the wrong side of it. But it's at least there as a placeholder, so that I can put people there when necessary.

When I don't create that line, I can actually perceive how everyone else is just like me. I may not have the tools to help reduce their delusion, but the last thing I want is to increase it by being cruel. It's unthinkable. It feels very much like smothering your own mentally ill child for misbehaving. Not physically smothering, but mentally, so that what little light they had left is extinguished. If this is sounding sinister, you're getting the picture. Each act of contempt contains all the evil there ever was.

Here's the crazy thing. When I do create that dividing line, this perception doesn't fully disappear. On one hand, there are now people who I perceive as fundamentally unlike me, and it no longer feels wrong to be nasty. On the other hand, part of me can still perceive that this is a lie, and that I'm being malevolent. But that part of me is not able to speak up or take the steering wheel. I won't let it. 

(This is exactly the state that evil people are in)

It's not that evil doesn't exist. It does; just not in the form of some bad people. It exists as the delusion that causes them to behave in the way they do, as well as the delusion that enables me to be cruel to them in the name of good. 

---

Let's back up and start with an example that I think everyone can relate to.

When someone holds a political view that I find abhorrent, I tend to perceive them as a bad person. That is, not a fundamentally decent person who's making bad choices, but a fundamentally defective person. I feel contempt, and I make no attempt to hide it. In fact, the more people who see it, the better.

But contempt doesn't actually make bad people better; it usually makes them worse. What I was really after was the feeling of self-righteousness that it gave me. It's like heroin. So I actually _wanted_ people to become worse, because that would just make it easier to prove how good I was.

Of course, there's no way you could have convinced me of this. I would have proven to you how my behavior was a net good. And I genuinely believed it. Or at least, part of me did. In truth, there was a schism in my mind. One side saw itself as the valiant hero, vanquishing the hordes of evil to bring about a better world, while the other part was busy creating those endless hordes.

Now, this may sound insane—and it is—but what I saw was that we're all playing a variant of this game. But for obvious reasons, we're unable to admit it, even to ourselves.

That's why you can't just shame a hypocrite out of being a hypocrite, unless you are largely free of this self-deception yourself. Because other people can subconsciously detect whether you're acting out of genuine good, or just veiled self-interest. And this makes all the difference.

If you're acting self-deceptively, then of course they're not going to accept any moralizing from you. In fact, they'll just turn around and try to shame _you_ in return. 

But if you're acting out of genuine good, then you will feel no malice whatsoever, and they can sense this, even if your behavior isn't remotely nice.

As a result, two things will happen:
1. They can feel that the criticism is coming from a source that has some genuine moral heft to it, and while they may still try to mount a lame defense, they will begin to suspect that it may indeed be lame.
2. Your lack of malice will remind them of something that they've long since forgotten. Namely, that there's nothing fundamentally wrong with them. Maybe they can loosen the defense mechanisms that have accumulated 




---

Now, when I'm interacting with them, no matter how carefully I try to hide this contempt, they can still feel it. And somehow, this doesn't make them reconsider their position. In fact, they just dig in their heels and think that I'm bad. And that doesn't really surprise me, because what else would such an obviously bad person do.

But here's the thing. I wasn't actually trying to hide my contempt. Some part of me wanted them to feel it, so that they would know how bad they were. And I knew this would make them double down. In fact, that's the reaction I was secretly trying to provoke, because that would morally license me to escalate my cruelty, which is what I actually wanted.

You see, their current behavior didn't yet rise to a level that warranted violence from me. But part of me fantasized about a world in which I _would_ have to lay down the law. Because that would cement my self-image as the righteous one. My behavior was secretly designed to boost my own ego, and this person was just collateral damage.

But if you had told me that this is what I was doing, I would have scoffed. Actually, I probably would have thought that _you_ were evil for impugning my motives like that. 



Now, why did I want to escalate? On one level, I didn't. My whole purpose was to make a better world. But part of me had other plans. Its only interest was to make me look good, and it had a very clever way of bringing this about. It did this by creating as much evil as possible, to provide it with an endless stream of enemies with which to prove its own righteousness. And the more evil they became, the greater the glory for vanquishing them.

Of course, you see the contradiction here. How can you prove your own righteousness by creating endless evil? So it had to produce a flawlessly compelling cover story which I could not see through. The way it did this was even more clever. It altered my very perception, so that instead of seeing a fallible human being doing their best, I saw someone who was fundamentally defective. Such a person cannot be helped. They can only be punished into submission.




---

Now why would I want to escalate? This is the crazy part. On the surface, I tell myself that I'm doing this to make a kinder world. But a deep part of me _needs_ evil people to exist, because the more evil there is for me to vanquish, the more I can demonstrate just how righteous I am. That part of me is willing to throw the entire world under the bus just to bolster my own self-image. That's evil. And although I can see that I'm doing this, I must never admit it to myself.

If I did, I would be admitting that I'm not fundamentally better than anyone. My entire carefully-constructed worldview and self-image would come crashing down. Therefore, I must double down. This leads to a runaway feedback loop of self-deception, in which the more evil I pump into the world, the more convinced I become that I am righteous. This process lives so deep in the mind that it alters my every perception, providing me with endless objective evidence that it's true. Anyone who doesn't see it is stupid or evil. This is a trap from which it is almost impossible to escape.

This may sound like an interesting theory, but one that can't be proven. And while it's true that I can't prove it scientifically, what I saw that day convinced me that it's possible for every one of us to see firsthand in an irrefutable way. 

That's possible because reality is actually one seamless whole, which you only appear to be separate from. That illusion of separateness is called the ego, and that's where we normally operate from. Underneath the ego, it is possible to glimpse certain truths directly. If that's not already too "woo" for you, buckle in for more.

The fundamental nature of mind is pure compassion. Not just your mind, but mind as a principle. But we lose contact with this truth. Then, being apparently separated from our true nature, we fear that we might not be entirely good.  And instead of confronting this fear directly, which would return us home, we project it outward onto other people, who we must now vanquish to prove our own goodness. But we know this is a sham, so our mind feels even more fear and guilt, and thus has to project even harder.

If we accede to this misperception, then this hell can never end. It can only grow worse. The only solution is to rediscover our primordial goodness. Not our relative goodness, in which we are better than others, but the deeper one in which we are all fundamentally the same.

What we all long for, whether we know it or not, is to return home. To put it in more conventional terms, we just want to feel okay, and not so ill-at-ease in a hostile world. But we go about it in such remarkably awful ways that we begin to convince ourselves that what we really want is something else, and this can get arbitrarily bad as our projections deepen. Some people are convinced that what will really bring them peace is genocide.

It is only once you see this process at work in yourself that you have any hope of helping others. From this perception, you begin to perceive the layers of self-deception that generate their apparent evil. And that gives you insight into how to undo it, so that they, too, begin to recall their true nature. On the surface, you may still be enemies, but on a deeper level, you are now allied in the only fight that actually matters: the fight against self-deception. The fight against evil.

This is called compassion. If the idea of being compassionate to bad people sounds naive, it's only because we've misunderstood what compassion means. It's not about being nice. True compassion can be fierce, or even violent if necessary. The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you. He said, well, shoot back with your own gun. How could that be compassionate?

It boils down to perception. If you perceive yourself as the valiant hero, fighting the hordes of fundamentally bad people out there, you will be acting from the ego. If you instead see that others are fundamentally just like you—that at some level, they just want the pain to stop, even if they're going about it in absurdly unskillful ways—then this _is_ compassionate, even if your behavior is not very nice.

Once this is seen, it becomes clear that any action you take from ego—that is, the perception of fighting a fundamentally separate world "out there"—will necessarily reinforce this illusion in the whole. The result is a more ruthless world. When you act from the recognition that we are all one, you weaken that violent tendency in the whole, even if your action is apparently violent.

I realize that this hard to swallow, and I don't want you to take my word for it. But if you sense any truth in this, I invite you to investigate it for yourself. I believe we are all capable of seeing this directly if we care to.

Also, to be fair, in real life this is all easier said than done. If I were confronted by Hitler, I would certainly not able to see the sense in which he is exactly like me, even though I've perceived it clearly before. If I tried to be compassionate, I would probably just get steamrolled, to the benefit of nobody. That's called idiot compassion, the false twin of true compassion, and it's a weakness that can be used against you. It's a lifetime of work to develop the wisdom to tell the difference. I don't mean to oversimplify any of this.

But one thing is clear to me. When I feel contempt or malice or self-righteousness toward _anybody_, it can only be because I'm falling into misperception. To the degree that I am capable of recognizing this trap in myself, and seeing things more clearly, I owe it to reality to do so. Otherwise I am just mindlessly perpetuating

[//]: # (When you're fighting evil, what you're really fighting is self-deception. And if you're feeling contempt, then you're being self-deceptive. Consider how crazy it is to believe that you can reduce the self-deception in the world by being self-deceptive yourself. It cannot possibly work. This isn't just a theory, but can be perceived directly. Let me explain.)

---

In 2008, I did a three month meditation retreat at a Tibetan center in the Colorado Rockies. There, I discovered something about the nature of evil that completely shattered my worldview. Of course, I'm not the first to realize it, but I want to share it in my own words. I believe this realization is crucial to the very survival of our species.


It began with the recognition that many of the times in my life that I thought I had been doing good, I was actually just causing harm. Worse still, I had known at the time that my behavior was harmful, but I wasn't able to admit it to myself while I was doing it.


In particular, I enjoyed being unkind to bad people. Now, you might wonder, what's wrong with being unkind to bad people? After all, they're bad. They don't deserve kindness. And this is the trap that I want to talk about.


What I saw was that my cruelty just made bad people worse. It also made the quote "good people" around me a little worse, even if they outwardly enjoyed my cruelty. Or especially if they enjoyed it. The net result was a darker world.


Now, it's very difficult to prove that the net effect was negative. And it is precisely this difficulty that allowed me to convince myself that I was actually doing a good thing. Let's take an example.


I used to feel (and still do feel) strongly about certain political issues. My opponents, who felt the opposite way, were clearly stupid or evil, and I never tired of reminding them of this. It was practically my duty as a good person.


Now, you probably see where I'm going with this. If a person feels insulted, are they likely to change their mind, or to dig in their heels? Are they likely to improve the lives of the people around them, or to spread more unkindness themselves? And what about my allies, who witnessed my behavior? Weren't they also more likely to resort to cruelty?

On the other hand, my behavior surely had some positive effects. For example, a bad person was silenced. And the good people felt more empowered to shut such people down. But, how could I know if the overall effect of my behavior was a net good or bad? This is where the story gets interesting.

Let's leave aside for a moment the question of whether it was actually a net good or bad. I saw that the deepest aspect of my mind felt that I was doing wrong. But it wouldn't allow me to see this, and so it had to concoct a believable cover story in which I was the valiant hero.

Now why would a supposedly good person behave this way? The answer is to serve my own ego. If others saw me fighting bad people, they would know that I was good. That was the true motivation behind much of my behavior, totally unbeknownst to me. I wanted it to be clear that I was good, and ironically, this was the source of so much bad.

But I also saw more, and this part is much harder to explain. I saw that the deepest aspect of my mind could actually perceive a subtle network of causality that my conscious mind was normally incapable of seeing. And from this perspective, I could see, unmistakably, that my behavior was resulting in a darker world.

Now, how could one possibly see such a thing? It's because reality is actually one seamless whole, which you only appear to be separate from. That illusion of separateness is called the ego, and that's where we normally operate from.



But beneath the ego, you are able to perceive certain universal truths directly. For example, that when you act from the ego—that is, from the illusion that you're at war with a world "out there"—you necessarily deepen this illusion of separateness in all other minds. The result is a world that is more inclined toward war. When you act from the recognition that we are all one, you weaken that violent tendency in the whole.

Now, I can't prove any of this to you, and I'm not going to try. But I would like to invite you to look inside and see if any of it resonates with you. Because I believe we are all capable of seeing this if we want to.

Now, why wouldn't we want to see it? Let me try to convey the experience more deeply. Buckle up, because this is a wild ride.



I saw that even while I (say) mocked a bad person, I could perceive that they were fundamentally the same as me. I could see that at the deepest level, they didn't want to cause harm. They just wanted to feel okay, but were going about it in a ridiculously terrible way. That's because they were lost in the maze of their grotesquely contorted mind. Yet I wanted to hurt them anyway.

I could also see that everyone else could also see all this. Together, we could choose to help this person out of their maze, thereby healing the world a little. On the other hand, we could instead choose to silently agree to pretend that we couldn't see this. That way, we could be cruel without fear of judgement.

You see, there are not many opportunities in the modern world for our darkness to express itself. We now have social norms that prevent such crass behavior. But being cruel to "bad people"—that's the one precious avenue we've left open to let our evil out. That's why we constantly search for people who we can call "bad."

I really want to hammer this in. I could see that deep inside that bad person's mind was a tiny distant voice crying out for help. And I knew that I could smother its cries, pushing it further into its pit of hell. And far from being scolded for this profound evil that I was knowingly and gleefully committing, others would wink and pat me on the back for being such a good person. It was the perfect crime.

The person could see all this himself, and for him, the world appeared insane for this astonishing hypocrisy. How could he not want to take revenge on such a backwards world. And I could see in advance that he would feel this way. I could also see how I would respond to his recalcitrance. I would feign dismay, and redouble my efforts. I was secretly gearing up for war—the ultimate battleground to prove my goodness once and for all.

From this perspective, the darkness didn't live inside each of us separately. Instead, it appeared like a single distributed organism, with tentacles embedded in all of our minds, knowing exactly how to manipulate us into doing its bidding without any of us realizing it. My darkness triggers yours, which retriggers mine, like a secret handshake. We may appear to be enemies, but we are allied in darkness.



When I am looking for bad people, that alliance is what I am secretly looking for. In fact, it goes deeper. The desire to see myself as fundamentally good necessitates the existence of people who are fundamentally bad. This itself is the darkness trying to take root in my mind. I can't put too fine a point on this. The mere desire to see myself as good is the first sign of evil.







The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung called this phenomenon "the shadow." He said:The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge. — Carl JungSuch a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day. — Carl Jung, 1975Although written in 1975, those gigantic problems are still unsolved today. And understanding the shadow is crucial if we are to solve them.

Let's take the example of climate change. We know that the oil industry has known about global warming for decades, but the executives covered it up, presumably to line their pockets. This is profound self-deception. It is part of their shadow.

Now if I choose to interact with them in the way I described before—with contempt and malice—then I am entering my own shadow. I am acting from self-deception. But it will not feel like that. To me, it will be obvious that I'm doing a righteous thing. I will even be able to prove it.

Alternatively, I could look more closely at what is really happening in my mind.

Now, I realize that from out here, in our normal minds, it feels naive to believe that Hitler is anything like us. That he was just a poor, lost soul that needed understanding. To be clear, I'm not suggesting that we feel sorry for him, or that we should be nice to

Now, why wouldn't we want to see it? The short answer is that it's painful to acknowledge that we've all been behaving like this. And that gives a clue as to why we do it in the first place. ...

So far, it may sound like only a bad person would act from the ego. But that's actually backwards: it's not that bad people act from their egos, it's that people who haven't realized the unity of being are only capable of acting from their egos, and it is those people who we label as bad.

See, it turns out that the most fundamental nature of your mind is pure goodness. And not just your mind, but mind as a principle. That's actually universal. But at some point, mind forgot its true nature, and as a result, fear emerged that it might not be so good. To deal with this fear, it projected that imaginary badness onto other people, who it could then attack for being bad, thereby proving its own goodness. This caused them to respond in kind, triggering an unvirtuous cycle that persists to this day.

When did this unwholesome cycle begin? This is where we return to the primordial paradox. Time is an illusion, and this cycle doesn't have a starting point in time. You could say that it's always starting right now. It is in this very moment that your mind forgets its true nature, and therefore has to project an entire reality to fight so that it can finally feel worthy of returning home to its source.

Unfortunately, it's really just punching a mirror, and the image in the mirror unsurprisingly punches back. So the mind has to punch harder and harder, intensifying a war that it can never win. The only solution is to stop punching the mirror.

Now, again, this may sound abstract. Let's look at it on the conventional level.

If I try to convince you that you're a bad person, your defense mechanisms will kick in, and you will behave in a way that lets you prove that you're good. The most obvious way to do that is to attack me in return, since I'm clearly a bad person for being so nasty to you. Especially because I'm pretending that I'm noble, which only the worst hypocrite would do.

On the other hand, if you are deeply connected to your fundamental source, then you will perceive my attack for what it really is: a cry for help. And this will give you insight into why I'm behaving this way, and what can be done to alleviate it. You may not have the mental or physical resources to help me, but you will not reflexively counterattack. That perception is called compassion.

It turns out that the people who we perceive as truly evil—the Hitlers of the world—are really just people who are profoundly lost in the maze of their own projections. That is to say that they suffer from exactly the same condition that we do, but it has progressed much further in them, to the point where it looks like something else entirely.

So, how do you deal with that level of evil? Even if you're moderately connected to your source as goodness, evil of that intensity will test your resolve. You won't be able to perceive any goodness in such a person, and thus the usual principle of compassion will seem to fly out the window. They will seem like an exception to the rule. This will allow the deepest evils of your mind to manifest, and you will feel justified in being cruel. That's bad.

On the other hand, you can't simply be nice to a Hitler. That would be even worse. So what's the solution?

The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you. He said, well, shoot back with your own gun. And then go cradle him in your lap. The point being, if you're not acting out of malice or contempt, then what appears to be violence may actually be in service to the world. And that gives us a clue.

Compassion isn't about being nice. It's about acting from the perception that you are not separate from reality. In other words, not acting from the ego. From this place, contempt and malice are seen to always be delusional. You perceive clearly that acting from such delusion can only produce more delusion. You can still behave in fierce ways, perhaps even employing violence if necessary, but the result will be radically different than if you had done this through ego.

Now, to be fair, this is all easier said than done. It's not like I act from compassion all the time. But one thing has become abundantly clear. And that is that when I'm acting from a place of contempt or self-righteousness, it is always my ego operating, and I'm liable to cause harm that I will have to confront somewhere down the line, in one form or another. Perhaps you could call this karma.

From this perspective, it becomes clear how we arrived at the political situation we are in, in the United States. Everyone is convinced that they are the good guys, and as such, have a moral responsibility to be unkind to the bad guys. What they can't see is that no matter how righteous their political views are, that entire mindset cannot help

Road to hell

There is a principle in psychology known as the Fundamental Attribution Error. It says that we judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their actions. Or, put another way, when we misbehave, it's because our circumstances forced our hand. When others misbehave, it's because of a character flaw. We're able to forgive ourselves more easily because we can see that deep down, we're actually good.

There are two senses in which a person might think of himself as good. The first is the one we're all familiar with: there are good people, and bad people, and we're one of the good ones. Let's call this "relative goodness." The second is someone who realizes that the mind's very nature is pure compassion, and that is shared among everyone. Such a person has realized their "absolute goodness." The only difference between these two people is that the first is confused about his true nature, while the second isn't.
