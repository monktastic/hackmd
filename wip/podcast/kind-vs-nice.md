"Kind" is the hardest word to define, and also maybe the most important—because it is the only thing that actually fights evil. It is not the same as "nice." Sometimes shooting someone is the kindest thing you can do [1].

We could say that it means being free from a particular kind of self-deception. Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? That's self-deception. Sometimes it is easy to detect in ourselves, but it's usually far more subtle.

One example that's hard to detect is contempt, especially for "bad people." If you're treating someone with contempt to help someone else, that's not kindness; it's pseudo-kindness. Why?

Contempt is the feeling that you're fundamentally better than someone. Not just that you hold better views, or act better, but are *intrinsically* better. It is a lie. There is a profound sense in which you are fundamentally the same as everyone else. This isn't realized fully until enlightenment [2], but everyone can sense it at some level. That's why certain literature [3] speaks to us so powerfully.

Contempt is a way to hide this from yourself, and is thus self-deceptive. It is a form of evil. The same goes for self-righteousness.

No matter how much we try to hide our contempt, others can feel it—and we secretly *want* them to, because it makes them *worse*: it separates them further from their "inner light." That is our actual goal; helping others is just a cover story. Why do we do this? To prove that they're bad, and thus that we're good. It is an ego game disguised as "fighting evil."

In actuality, our true nature — our inner light — is fundamentally good. But we lose contact with it, so we go out searching for our goodness relatively — that is, at other people's expense. That is why we have a strong motivation to see people as "bad": they are simply the people we license ourselves to be cruel to. Ironically, it is our memory of our original goodness that makes us act this way.

This process can go off the rails much harder, until there's effectively no memory left of our inner light, and no discernible desire to be good. We call such people "evil," but the distinction is merely conventional. The solution is always the same: it is to lead people back to their "light." Anything else is deception.

Sometimes this requires being sweet and loving, and other times it may require a bullet. Either way, it is kindness. It is compassion. But the closer you are to choosing "bullet," the more confident you better be in your capacity to detect extremely subtle self-deception — because the deepest part of you knows the truth, and sooner or later you will have to confront it [4].

Any ideology based on pseudo-kindness — and there are many today — contains the seeds of its own destruction, but can produce tremendous suffering in the mean time. Here's hoping that humanity adopts an ideology based in authentic kindness.
