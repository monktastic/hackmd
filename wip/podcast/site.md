Humanity is in the grip of an _insanely_ clever foe that we might call "evil." We all have a role to play in defeating it—but the solution is profoundly counterintuitive, which is why we have been getting our asses handed to us.

Imagine you witness an atrocity. If your mind were free of evil, you would feel absolutely no malice. You would more easily perceive the (inner and outer) conditions that led to the person being able to do this, which would enable a more effective response; one that does not amplify hostility in the world. This is called compassion—even if it requires violence[0]. It reduces evil.

Evil alters your very perception, so that you literally see "bad person" and wish to cause harm. It might be as "innocent" as mockery or shaming[1]. But however "well-intentioned," such behavior is subconsciously designed to create *more* enmity and suffering; to increase evil in the world. This fact will be cleverly hidden from you. You will come away feeling righteous; like you "fought evil."

This self-deception is extremely difficult to detect in ourselves, because it would provoke a painful recognition of our own hypocrisy. Yet without this insight, the true reason for other people's misbehavior stays hidden from us, and we remain hapless pawns in evil's sinister game. It knows exactly how to manipulate our minds so that we eagerly spread it without ever suspecting it.

If you still harbor the tendency for contempt (and I certainly do), then you are surely leaking evil into the world somewhere, somehow, without realizing it. The best thing you can do for the world is heal the part of you that's enabling this. Meditation, psychedelics, trauma work, shadow work, whatever. Please don't let it fester.

You don't have to take my word for it. Part of you knows this perfectly well. You only need to discover what's blocking that knowledge from being fully conscious.

[1] There is a subtlety here: just like with violence, mocking or shaming *can* sometimes be the best response. But they work (and feel) entirely differently when not motivated by evil. I think of these as advanced techniques, because it's so easy to fool oneself.

## FAQ / glossary / notes

### Self-deception (aka willful ignorance)

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but convinced yourself it was okay? Try and recall what that state is like. You knew perfectly well that what you were doing was wrong (according to your own conscience), but that knowledge was carefully hidden from conscious self-reflection.

This mechanism is ultimately responsible for _all_ misbehavior. Even the most "evil" person could not do what they do without it. They know perfectly well that what they're doing is wrong, but that knowledge is very cleverly hidden from the aspect of their mind [see "inner light"] that would put an end to it.

Conversely, you yourself are capable of almost anything under the right circumstances. This is very hard to accept about ourselves, so we try to hide it—thus leading to even _more_ self-deception.

As much as we want to judge others for their self-deception, trying to run their noses in it while still in the grip of our own just backfires—and this isn't entirely by accident, as we shall see.

### Contempt

Contempt (for a person) is the feeling that you're fundamentally better than someone. Not just that you hold better views, or act better, but are *intrinsically* better. You see them as intrinsically morally defective.

There is a profound sense in which you are fundamentally the _same_ as everyone else [see "inner light"]. This isn't realized fully until enlightenment, but everyone can sense it at some level. That's why certain literature [3] speaks to us so powerfully. Contempt is a way to hide this fact from yourself, and is thus self-deceptive.

You may not be able to detect this in yourself, but others can—even if only subconsciously. They know the game you're playing. So they can't help but see _you_ as a "bad person" and feel compelled to fight your evil. You act dismayed by this recalcitrance, but you were secretly intending to provoke it, because it _proves_ your intrinsic superiority. Encouraging contempt in our "allies" is evil for the same reason.

This is how evil leverages our ego to do its dirty work.

It can be _extremely hard_ to admit that we're doing this, for obvious reasons. But it is not until we see why it's so hard that we begin to understand why it's difficult for the "bad people" to own up to (or even recognize) _their_ self-deception—and we can't fix what we don't understand. That's why the first step in fighting evil is confronting our own self-deception.

### Why was "allies" in quotes?

The people who share your particular brand of contempt aren't actually your allies. If they were, they would call you out on such behavior.

Similarly, your real enemy is evil, not the people themselves.

### Inner light

The Buddhists (amongst others) believe that the fundamental nature of mind is pure compassion. But it's not just a belief: anyone with the time and desire can discover this for themselves. You can also get a taste of it on psychedelics.

From this layer of mind, you can perceive that the same is true of all others, too. It's just a feature of mind itself, strange as that may sound.

However, for various reasons, we lose contact with our "absolute goodness," which forces us to seek it _relatively_; that is, at the expense of others. We _need_ to see others as "bad" so that we can know ourselves as "good." This gives us an incentive to _make_ them bad. Unfortunately, even as we do so, part of us knows that we're doing this, making us feel even more guilty, thus intensifying the process and forcing us to hide it even harder, ad infinitum.

In other words, in this state I _need_ evil to exist, so that I always have something to fight, to prove how good I am.

Ironically, it is our memory of our original goodness that is the root cause of our misbehavior. But by rediscovering our fundamental goodness—and thus everyone else's—we can stop contributing to this horrific cycle.

### Isn't it a little hyperbolic to call contempt "evil"?

Not once you fully uncover it. Then you can practically _feel_ the darkness inside your mind reaching out and offering a "secret handshake" to theirs, to further separate them from their inner light. On the surface, you are enemies, but your evil is secretly allied.

A part of your mind is _knowingly_ and _gleefully_ extinguishing light from the world. This is every bit as malevolent as it sounds. Just pause and notice how contempt, malice, hatred, and malevolence all have the same "flavor" or "signature."

When you fight your "enemy" with genuine compassion, your _light_ is becoming allied with theirs. At some level, they can sense that you are not attacking _them_, but the evil in their minds. Bystanders can also sense this, and it makes them better—even if your response was outwardly violent.


### Evil people?

Some beings have become so separated from their inner light that there's effectively no memory of it left, and thus no discernible desire to be "good" in any meaningful sense. (Note that by this definition, even Hitler may not qualify: he believed he was doing good for humanity; loved his dog; etc. True _malevolence_ is exceedingly rare, thankfully.) It seems fair to apply the label "evil" to such people, but there are two caveats.

First, contempt and malice are *still* the wrong response, for exactly the same reason as before. 

Second, we often use the term "evil" as a cudgel for people who are nowhere near it: from their perspective, they really are doing what they consider "good." Our political rivals are a common example. This is just a license to be cruel.

The greatest risk when confronting evil is that it will trigger our own, as described before. I genuinely don't know what to do in such situations, but I like to remember this fact:

While it is surely true that "evil wins when good people do nothing," the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.

The deeper the evil you confront, the greater the risk of "secretly joining forces with it."

(Also note that "good people" as used here can be a problematic phrase if it implies the existence of fundamentally bad people.)

### Kindness / compassion

Compassion (which we're using interchangeably with "kindness") is the hardest word to define, but also the most important, since it is the only thing that actually ends evil.

We could say that it's acting in accordance with one's inner light. We could also say that it's acting free of self-deception, which amounts to the same thing. But it can be _exceptionally_ hard to detect self-deception in ourselves, which is what makes this definition so challenging. Many of our deeply-held moral convictions turn out to be self-deceptive in the final analysis.

There are two ways we usually get the definition wrong:

1. It does not simply mean "nice." Sometimes, being sweet and loving is the most compassionate response, and sometimes not. See the Dalai Lama quote, for example.

2. Hating bad people is not kind; it is _evil_. Also see pseudo-kindness.

By this definition, kindness is _always_ the right motivation in every circumstance. You could say that kindness is never "for" a particular person, but only ever for reality as a whole.

Also, if you determine that being loving is the wrong response, that is an especially important time to check for subtle self-deception. This is where we most often get it wrong.

How does this "end evil"? By cutting through people's self-deception; i.e., reminding them of their inner light. Yes, even shooting someone can do that under the right circumstances.

### Pseudo-kindness

This is when we are cruel (i.e., contemptuous, malicious, etc.) to one person in the name of helping another. It is cleverly-disguised evil.

I am a vegetarian. I am embarrassed to admit that there was a time when I thought that contempt for non-vegetarians was good because it helped animals. That was pseudo-kindness.

(And on the flip side, I believe that veganism is even kinder, but have not been able to bring myself to do it for longer than a year. This is self-deception—though to be perfectly clear, your own compassion may point you to a different answer, and that is perfectly fine.)

I'm sure you can identify other pseudo-kind ideologies.

### Idiot compassion

(Coined by Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.) 

This is the inverse of pseudo-kindness: it is when we are _nice_ to someone in a way that enables bad behavior, because we can't bring ourselves to do the difficult but right thing.

### Evil as a distributed organism

When you witness evil in another person, _yours_ gets triggered. It may feel like yours exists to fight theirs, but this is a trick: evil is only ever on its own team.

In this way, it behaves like a distributed organism, signaling to itself through the vast network of human minds. From a certain perspective, it appears to be intelligent. It knows exactly how to keep us busy fighting each other so that we never suspect the true cause.

### Are _you_ a saint / enlightened?

Hell no.

### Then what gives you the right to lecture me on morality?

Sorry, that's not the intent. I am a complete hypocrite and have no right to lecture anyone. I'm just sharing something I've seen, because I believe it is helpful.

- Origin of evil

- Conspiracy
  It leverages our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us would claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.
 
- Your enemy is not other people; it is the parasite in their minds.

- Outrage, judgement, compassion definitions.

- We think that hating bad people is a sign of the good within us, but it's really a sign of the evil.

- Evil's greatest trick is to convince you that it doesn't exist within your own mind; or if it does, that it exists to fight the evil "out there."

- To the degree that you believe that you are immune, it's an unmistakable sign that the darkness has _already_ colonized the deepest aspect of your mind.

- Civil war, divorce, armageddon

- I could see that deep inside that bad person's mind was a tiny distant voice crying out for help. And I knew that I could smother its cries, pushing it further into its pit of hell. And far from being scolded for this profound evil that I was knowingly and gleefully committing, others would wink and pat me on the back for being such a good person. It was the perfect crime.

- Fundamental attribution error

- Impulse to assume bad faith

- Since you can't fix a fundamentally broken person, you feel compelled to harm them

- *Any time* you see "bad person" and / or feel malice, it is the evil trying to get a grip on your mind. It's often much more subtle than outright malice (e.g., contempt), but you know the feeling I'm pointing to. It includes dehumanization and objectification. This is always a trap, even when (or especially when) it is done in the service of "good."
