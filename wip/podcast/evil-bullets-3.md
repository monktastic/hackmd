There is a parasite that lives deep within people's minds that is the ultimate source of their misbehavior. How does it work?

[Person puppet]

Well, have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify it to avoid feeling bad? Of course you have; you're human. Try and recall what that state is like. The deepest part of you isn't okay with what's happening, but your mind finds a clever way to justify it. This is willful ignorance; self-deception. It is caused by your parasite.

[Blinders]

The deepest layer of your mind lives beneath the parasite, and is always unaffected by it. Let's call this your inner light. It can always perceive the inner light within other people, no matter how well hidden. It knows that they only misbehave because of their parasite, and that they wish to be free of it, despite appearance to the contrary. It also has insight into how to help them become free.

This poses a threat to the parasite, so it does something clever: it prevents you from seeing the true cause of other people's misbehavior, by making you perceive them as fundamentally defective. This way you will hate them and treat them with contempt. Contempt encourages people to become more self-deceptive, which strengthens their parasite.

This is how evil is continually created while making everyone feel righteous about creating it. If left unchecked, this results in a kind of Armageddon, in which everyone is violently proving just how righteous they are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. It is what leads to bitter divorces, in which both sides feel like the exclusive victim / hero. And there's more.

Our parasites secretly work together, with my misbehavior triggering yours. In this way, all of our parasites act like a single distributed super-organism, where human minds form the vast network by which it communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold. This evil organism is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.

It is an evil global conspiracy, and we are its members.

The evil system cannot be overthrown by people using contempt and malice to overthrow it. Or rather, it can, but it will be replaced by an equally evil system with only some details shuffled around. Your parasite is _very_ clever at convincing you that this case is different, and malice is really warranted. This is always a lie. Your malice always leaks out into the world and darkens it.

With enough sensitivity, this can all be perceived directly. It's not just a wild theory. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see it, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

Only your inner light can end this madness. That is called compassion. It doesn't have to be nice. 

The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That can be compassionate. It can help the gunman and/or others become free of their self-deception. But it only works to the degree that you are free of your own. In other words, to the degree that you're not acting from malice, contempt, self-righteousness, etc. People can sense this, and it weakens their parasite.

This is ultimately the only way to end evil. May we figure this out before it's too late.

Your parasite alters your very perception, so that instead of seeing that bad people are under the influence of their parasite, you perceive them as being fundamentally morally defective, unlike you.

[Lenses]

Fighting their parasite would actually reduce the evil in the world. Instead, your parasite makes you fight the people themselves. This only strengthens the parasite in both of your minds, thus increasing the evil. 

[Fighting demon in mind]

This is what happens when we mock our political opponents, and they just dig in their heels. By obeying our parasite, we are creating more evil, while being flawlessly convinced that we're being totally righteous.

[Red vs blue]

Maybe you start by hating the people across the aisle, until someone points out that the real enemies are the evil elites who are playing us off each other. So now you hate them. Either way, it is the cumulative effect of all of our hatred which manifests as the evil world order in which none of us recognize our own complicity. It behaves like a super-organism, made of all of our parasites combined.

[Super-organism]

This is the granddaddy of all evil conspiracies. All the others ultimately filter up to this one, which we ourselves play a vital role in. That is why we're unable to end the evil in the world. One hand is fighting it while the other is secretly creating it. It is almost too crazy to believe, which is why we never suspect it.

[Evil conspiracy]

With enough sensitivity, this can all be perceived directly. It's not just a wild theory. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see it, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

From this perspective, it becomes obvious that my contempt and malice exist _only_ to shove people deeper into the grip of their parasite, so that I can prove how bad they are, so that I can unleash even more righteous fury. This isn't _fighting_ evil; it _is_ evil. And part of me has always known this.

Your enemy is not other people. It is the parasite within their minds. Sometimes, fighting their parasite may take the form of fighting them. Other times, it looks like loving them. Either way, there will be no malice involved. 

That is why if you want to end the evil out there, you must end it in here. Otherwise, you will secretly be creating more without realizing it. May we all develop the wisdom to finally be free of evil.

There is a mind-parasite that is destroying the world, and it lives within your own mind. I want to try and point it out. This will not be easy, because the parasite is insanely clever at hiding itself.

[Smoky demon]

Bring to mind a "bad person." Say, one of your political nemeses. Ready? Okay, can you feel the contempt that accompanies that thought? It feels like the contempt is there to improve the world. But this is the parasite talking. Let me explain.

[Trump - Biden]

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify it to avoid feeling bad? Of course you have; you're human. Try and recall what that state is like. The deepest part of you isn't okay with what's happening, but your mind finds a clever way to justify it. This is willful ignorance; self-deception. This is the secret mechanism behind all the misbehavior in the world. 

[Blinders]

People know that what they are doing is wrong, but another part of them _does not_ know. If you can empower the part of them that knows, you will weaken their self-deception, and thereby heal the world. Contempt serves exactly the opposite purpose: by being nasty to people, you are encouraging more self-deception. Think about it: has your contempt or malice ever made anyone better? No, it makes both them and everyone around you nastier.

[Angel and devil]

This isn't an accident. Contempt is always self-deception. It exists only to distract you from your own misbehavior by focusing on somebody else's. Hating the bad people proves that you're good, which licenses you to commit evil while feeling completely righteous. Pushing people further into their self-deception is evil. Contempt is evil.

[Half evil face]

This is exactly the same thing your enemies are doing. Part of you knows this, but that knowledge is so distasteful that you must hide it from yourself. You do this by feeling even more contempt, malice, hatred, etc. which helps you overlook your misbehavior even more. This is the downward spiral that humanity is trapped in.

[Red vs blue]

You don't want to be doing any of this, but you can't help it, because there's a parasite lodged deep inside your mind. This parasite alters your very perception of reality in a way that makes such behavior inevitable. You literally see a world that desperately needs your contempt. This is the same parasite that plagues other people, and causes their misbehavior.

[parasite putting glasses on you]

Your enemy isn't other people; it is the parasite inside their minds. If you fight the person, you will create more evil. If you fight the parasite, you will eliminate evil. Confusingly, fighting the parasite sometimes looks like fighting the person, but not always. Often, fighting the parasite looks like loving the person. It depends entirely on the circumstances.

[Fighting demon within mind]

The deepest part of every mind yearns to be free of their parasite. The deepest part of your mind can see this in everyone, but your parasite tries to make you overlook it. It says: "Don't be naive. This person is different. Malice is necessary here." This is the ultimate trap. It is their infection spreading to you. Don't let it.

[Person puppet to evil]

If you can perceive the part of their mind that wants to be free, you cannot help but give it a hand. Not only will you _want_ to help, but you will have much deeper insight into how to help. If you can't perceive it, malice is still the wrong response. The only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the stronger their evil, the more tempted you will be to do this.

This is compassion. It doesn't mean being nice. The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That can be compassionate. It can help the gunman and/or others be free of their self-deception. But it only works to the degree that you are free of your own. In other words, to the degree that you're not acting from malice, contempt, self-righteousness, etc. People can sense this, and it weakens their parasite.

Our parasites communicate, with mine attempting to trigger yours. Consciously, we may feel like enemies, but our parasites are secretly allied.

In this way, all of our parasites behave like a single distributed super-organism, and human minds form the vast network by which it communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold. This organism is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.

This is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that people fear is secretly running the world: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem, yet which nobody can see—and _we_ are its unwitting minions. Except, again, it's not really unwitting. We just pretend not to see our role.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding the beast. This behavior ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show—or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are ultimately also minions of our collective shadow.

Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we string up, we secretly instruct reality to immediately fill their shoes. All that changes are the specifics of their evil. It is as though our left hand doesn't know what our right is doing.

With enough sensitivity, this can all be perceived directly. It's not just a wild theory. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see it, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

This is impossible to communicate, but I'll try. You discover that you could _always_ perceive the deepest aspect of other people's minds; the part that only ever wants to be free. You just pretended not to. Instead of helping this part out, you gave it a knowing wink and shoved it further into hell. It is as though you were smothering its secret cries for help by pretending not to recognize them. This is every bit as sinister as it sounds. I still shudder when I think about it.

Yet it is not as though I have entirely stopped doing it. The parasite still lives within me. So please don't think I am lecturing you on how to be a good person, because I myself am not one. I only tell you this to share what I have seen. I hope you will hold me accountable when I am misbehaving. I promise to do the same for you.

Please, let's not let the parasite win.
