Have you ever suspected that there's an evil conspiracy responsible for all the world's horrors? Well there kind of is, and it's much more insidious than you think. Buckle up.

Have you ever done something that deep down you felt was wrong, but then found a way to justify it to avoid feeling bad? Of course you have; you're human.

This is willful ignorance; self-deception. Try and recall what that state is like. The deepest part of you isn't okay with what's happening, but your mind finds a clever way to hide that fact from conscious self-reflection. This is exactly the same mechanism that enables apparently-evil people to do what they do. They know that what they're doing is wrong, but in another sense, they don't.

The "bad people" remind us of something in ourselves that we'd rather not see, so our mind finds a clever way to hide it from us. It makes us perceive them as intrinsically morally defective, unlike us, the good people. You cannot fix a broken person, so our only option is to hate them, and treat them with contempt. Unfortunately, this backfires miserably.

That's because our contempt is self-deceptive, and although we do not consciously recognize it as such, other people can smell it from a mile away. So they perceive us as intrinsically bad, and feel morally obligated to fight our evil in return.

A classic example is when we mock our political opponents. Somehow they don't just apologize and repent. They double down and vow to return the favor, which just convinces us that we were right about them after all. We act dismayed by their recalcitrance, but this is what we secretly wanted, because it licenses us to unleash our full righteous fury.

The secret end goal is a kind of Armageddon, in which we get to violently prove just how good we are. This is why the US is headed toward civil war, with nobody recognizing their own complicity. It is what leads to bitter divorces, in which both sides feel like the exclusive victim / hero. This isn't by accident. Your contempt and malice exist only to darken the world while making you feel self-righteous.

Deep down we don't want to act this way, but we can't help it, because our minds are infected by an insanely clever parasite. This parasite is the source of our self-deception. One of its tricks is to prevent us from seeing that the "bad people" are simply under the sway of the very same parasite. It tricks us into hating them, so that we strengthen the parasite in both of our minds.

In this way, our parasites act like a single distributed super-organism, and our minds form the vast network by which it communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold. It is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that none of us claim to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our collective self-deception.

This is that archetypal "evil conspiracy" that people fear is secretly running the world: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem, yet which nobody can see—and we are its unwitting minions. Except, again, it's not really unwitting. We just pretend not to see our role.

Every time we feel malice, contempt, hatred, etc. toward anyone—no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of—we are secretly feeding the beast. This behavior ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show—or rather, appear to run the show, since they too are ultimately also minions of our collective shadow.

Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we vengefully string up, we secretly instruct reality to immediately fill their shoes. All that changes are the specifics of their evil. It is as though our left hand doesn't know what our right is doing.

With enough sensitivity, this can all be perceived directly. It's not just a wild theory. As far as I can tell, everyone who learns to pay close enough attention to their inner experience discovers this sooner or later. It may require meditation, psychedelics, or both. But the first time you see it, you will fall to your knees in agony over the heartbreaking horror of it all, and your secret role in it.

This is impossible to communicate, but I'll try. You discover that you could always perceive the deepest aspect of other people's minds; the part that only ever wants to be free of their parasite. But instead of helping it out, you gave it a knowing wink and shoved it further into hell. It is as though you were smothering its secret cries for help by pretending not to recognize them as such. Recalling this still sends shudders down my spine. The only solace is that we never wanted to act this way, and we always have another chance to set things right.

Your enemy is not other people; it is the parasite within their minds. Yet it would be a mistake to go out and fight other parasites without doing some inner work first. Because to the degree that you are still under the sway of your own parasite, your distorted perception will ensure that you will just be doing its evil bidding. You will end up encouraging more evil somewhere, somehow, in some way that you will be unable to perceive.

This is why our parasite keeps our attention fixated outward, on all the evil "out there" instead of what's happening in here. Because that way, we will avoid doing the one thing that could actually end it, and instead, end up strengthening it.

Now, to be fair, waiting til you are entirely free of your parasite to fight evil would be crazy, because the parasite is what the Buddhists know as "the ego," and freedom from it is enlightenment. Until then, the best I seem able to do is to stay powerfully alert to that tendency in myself that wants to perceive other people as intrinsically bad. Because the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.

With those blinders off, it is much easier to perceive the complexity in any given situation. The parasite oversimplifies: it sees "good guys" and "bad guys," and its brilliant plan is to "smash the bad guys." It makes us overlook the astonishing array of causes and conditions that led to their behavior, which would actually enable us to do something genuinely useful about it.

This is called compassion. It's not about being nice. Compassion is simply the result of seeing clearly. From this perception, we may still have to take fierce or possibly even violent action.

The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That can be compassionate, if you're not acting from your parasite. In that case, you won't see a "bad person," and there won't be even a trace of malice or self-righteousness. Other people can subconsciously sense the purity of this motivation, and it makes all the difference in the world. It actually weakens their parasites and yours.

There's a lot more to be said about how to develop such compassion, and how to apply it in difficult situations. But I hope this gives a tiny glimpse of why it is the only thing that can save us from the demon that plagues us.
