## Intro

In 2008, while on a three-month self-led mostly-silent meditation retreat at a Tibetan center in the Rockies, I uncovered a massive global evil conspiracy that is responsible for all the horrors of the world. But that was nothing compared to the horrible discovery that I was one of its card-carrying members.

That gave me a tiny bit of insight into how to bring it down from the inside, which I'd like to share. Toward the end, I'll explain the role that I think psychedelics can play in this transformation.

Allow me to build up to that. I'll start by talking about the nature of evil.

---

## Ch 1: evil

- Evil's greatest trick is to convince you that it doesn't exist within your own mind; or if it does, that it exists to fight the evil "out there."

- It hides our own hypocrisy from us while making us highly sensitive to it in others. We excuse our own, while condemning it in others.

- That's because our evil has us convinced that we are fundamentally good, unlike them. Therefore, we don't have to play by the same rules.
  - We can safely engage in behaviors that we wouldn't tolerate in others, because we are doing it to _fight_ evil, whereas they do it because they _are_ evil.
  - We can also let our guard down. We don't have to worry about sliding down the slippery slope of evil ourselves, because that only happens to bad people.

- But that belief is itself the most reliable indicator that it has already infected the deepest aspect of our mind.

- We are all carrying a mind virus that has learned not only how to prevent us from eradicating it, but how to convince us to spread it with glee.

- If we do not see this trick, we will not survive.

---

## Ch 2: self-deception

- The deepest aspect of our mind knows right from wrong. That's our conscience—not to be confused with our consciousness.
 
- We sometimes act against our conscience: we do things that deep down we feel are wrong, but we don't let this knowledge into our conscious minds. Instead, our minds concoct a very clever cover story in which what we're doing is okay. This is self-deception.

- All the evil in the world ultimately boils down to some form of self-deception, but we rarely recognize it as such. We don't see in others a more extreme form of something that we ourselves are engaged in; we believe we're looking at a different phenomenon entirely.

- We don't see a person who, like us, is fundamentally decent, but flawed. We perceive a fundamentally "bad person." Someone morally defective, unlike us. Think about your political opponents.

- Because we're decent people, we may first try to correct them before escalating to emotional and then perhaps physical violence.

- But part of us knows that it's pointless to try and fix a broken person, so our attempts are half-hearted at best: less correction and more condescension. 

- Yet we already know that this isn't going to work, and we're already prepping for the inevitable escalation. We act dismayed, but part of us is secretly itching for a fight.

- Your conscience can actually perceive how this person is ultimately just like you, and neither deserving of, nor helped by, contempt.

- But the darkness in your mind distorts your perception so that you don't see this. It causes you to instead perceive a "bad person"; someone whom it is your duty to treat with contempt. Because it knows that this will provoke escalation.

- Such behavior will encourage everyone — you, your victim, your allies, bystanders — to become slightly nastier people.

- Whatever temporary positive effects may come from it, the world will become a little darker.

- But you won't consciously register this. Your darkness will ensure that all you see is that you were righteously fighting evil. If the world becomes a little darker as a result, well, that's entirely on your evil enemy.


- It is really worth pausing to feel how compelling that story is. How natural it is to feel contempt for bad people. How obviously righteous that is. How difficult it would be for anyone to talk you out of that perspective while you're in it. You may not even believe me right now.

- But part of your mind knows unequivocally that it is a sham; that such behavior doesn't actually serve the purpose it pretends to. Yet it is so flawlessly compelling.
 

- If you can lay bare just this one trick with complete clarity, you will understand the secret mechanism behind all the evil there ever was, and why it is so hard to eradicate.

- There's only one thing that actually works.

---

## Ch 3: compassion

- No, I'm not going to tell you to be nice. The problem isn't that you were being mean, it's that you were being self-deceptive.

- Part of you knew, even as you were doing it, that you were acting against your conscience.

- No matter how well you hide this from yourself and others, people can always sense it, even if only subconsciously. 
  - Contempt and self-righteousness are _always_ signs of self-deception, and they are secretly invitations for others to do the same.


- The opposite of self-deception is compassion.

- That word probably evokes images of people being soft and nice. While those are surely fine qualities, they are worse than useless against evil.

- But that's not what compassion means. Our darkness makes us conflate "compassionate" with "nice" precisely to prevent us from discovering the one thing that can actually kill it. 

- **In truth, compassion can be as fierce or potentially even violent as the situation warrants.** 

- The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. That's... not nice. But in what sense is it compassionate?

- Compassion is the realization that at the deepest level, all you really want is for everything to feel totally okay, and that this is what everyone else wants, too (despite obvious appearance to the contrary). 

- But it's not enough to simply _believe_ this. If you look at a Hitler and think oh, poor guy just wants to feel better, well, that's not going to end well.

- There must be an authentic perception of the true nature of reality for the compassion to be genuine. Only then can it serve the purpose of defeating evil.

---

## Ch 4: your true nature

- Reality is actually one seamless whole which you only appear to be separate from. This illusion of separateness is called the ego, and it is our normal mode of operation. But below that level of mind, certain universal truths can be glimpsed.

- In particular, you discover that the nature of mind is intrinsically compassionate. It's what you most fundamentally are.

- And this isn't just true of your mind; it's a truth about minds in general. You may wonder how it's possible to discover truths about other people's minds, and the short answer is that they're not truly other. It's... hard to explain.

- Maybe the simplest way to convey this is that when a mind is completely clear and unconfused at its very deepest levels, it has no desire for malice. It perceives the incredible miracle of reality and naturally desires to be in service to it.

- Being separated from our true nature is intrinsically painful, and humans do the darndest things to try and get back.

---

- You've probably heard the saying that "hurt people hurt people."

- In fact, you've probably had an experience where someone was misbehaving, but then at some point you realized that their behavior was actually caused by pain and not by some kind of intrinsic moral defect.
  - Maybe you found out that their mom just died.
  - Or maybe their behavior matches a pattern you've seen before, or done yourself.
  - Or maybe you just _saw_ something in their eyes that gave it away.

- You may not be able to put your finger on _how_ you know, but you know. When that happens, your malice just evaporates. It's _obviously_ the wrong tool for the job.

- When you are in contact with your true nature, you can perceive directly that ALL misbehavior is ultimately rooted in some kind of pain. At the deepest level, it is the pain of being separated from their true nature.
  - From there, you perceive directly that malice is always the wrong response.
  - Malice, contempt, etc. exist _only_ as tools for your darkness. They serve no other purpose.

- Yet, that doesn't mean that _violence_ is always the wrong response (though, to be clear, it very often is).

---

## Ch 5

- Remember, compassion doesn't mean being nice. It just means acting from authentic insight into the hidden causes of misbehavior.
  - From this perception, you will be able to see that this person has been overtaken by a kind of mind-virus. Your enemy is that virus, and not the person.
  - It may still require you to hurt the person, but you won't feel any malice while doing so, any more than you feel malice for your dog when the vet has to remove a tapeworm.

- It may not seem like this change in intention matters much, but it makes all the difference in the world.

- You can mock or shame someone with malice, or with compassion, and though the two actions may look almost identical from the outside, the ultimate result will be wildly different.
  - That's because people are ridiculously sensitive to our true intentions, even if only subconsciously.

- If you act from compassion, part of them can sense that you're not actually fighting _them_. This weakens their defenses, because try as they may to grasp at your hypocrisy to deflect, they're not going to find any.
  - The more precisely you target the parasite in their minds, the more clearly they begin to see it in themselves, and how it is not who they are.
  - Seeing this, they cannot help but join in the fight against it.
  - This may not be happening at the conscious level, but it is happening.
  - A powerful seed has been planted. Not only in their minds, but also that of bystanders.
  - This won't provide you with that instant hit of self-righteousness that malice does. But the joy of watching even a tiny bit of evil evaporate from the world is satisfying on a much deeper level.

- The alternative is to be malicious; to target the person. This will have the opposite effect. 
  - The parasite in your mind is secretly activating the parasite in theirs, to create more evil under the guise of good.

---

- The whole fight against evil comes down to how clearly you can perceive the true causes of misbehavior in other people's minds. In other words, compassion.
  - And this is only possible to the degree that you have identified and resolved it in yourself. 

- **That is why evil's most powerful trick is to keep our attention fixated outwards, on the evil "out there." By doing this, it very effectively prevents us from doing the inner work that would actually be able to end it.**


- Now, to be clear, this is all much easier said than done.

- Unless you are _completely_ free of self-deception yourself — in other words, enlightened — there will always be some level of evil that you will be unable to handle.
  - In such cases, your attempts to be compassionate may actually backfire.

- That's not because compassion is the wrong approach; it's because you haven't developed sufficient insight to be genuinely compassionate. You may end up just being nice, and making things worse.

- Determining when you actually have the skill, and when you don't, and what do to about it is the work of a lifetime or lifetimes, and I still have a long way to go here.

- But what I do know is that these are the most crucial times to be alert to my tendency to turn malicious.
  - Because while it's true that evil triumphs when good people do nothing, the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it.
  - In fact, the very idea that there are such "good people," and thus "bad people" in some intrinsic sense, is already joining forces with it.


- As an aside, it is said that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." This is not referring to genuine compassion. It refers to our self-deceptive "good intentions."

- It can be extremely difficult to tell which of these we are operating from in any given moment. That is why it is so crucial to gain skill in telling them apart.

## Ch 6: meditation

- This helps explain why even breathing meditation can be effective at inducing kindness. It helps you become aware of what your mind is actually doing.

- Let me use an analogy. Have you ever been reading a book, only to realize that your eyes are still scanning the page while your mind is doing something else entirely?

- Were you conscious or unconscious during that time? 
  - On one hand, if I had interrupted your reverie and asked what you were thinking about, you could have told me, because you were conscious.
  - On the other hand, you weren't aware that you were doing it. That's why it felt like an "oops" when you realized it.

- This should astonish you. You are capable of doing things with full consciousness yet without knowing that you're doing them.

- Self-deception works on a similar principle. We know what we're doing, and yet simultaneously, we don't. That's how malevolent people can do what they do without remorse. 
  - Unlike with the reading example, it is very hard to simply shake someone out of this state.
  - In fact, the deeper they are in it, the more likely that we will simply get drawn in ourselves.
  - It is as though we are becoming possessed.

- You may think you would recognize the signs of possession in yourself, but you have _no idea_ how insanely sneaky it is. It masquerades as the voice in your mind. It feels like you.

- The way that preliminary forms of meditation work is by keeping us extremely alert to what is actually happening in our minds, as opposed to what we _think_ is happening. More thinking cannot fix this. I cannot emphasize this strongly enough.

- It took me weeks of full-time meditation to begin to notice how easily my mind was hijacked without my awareness. And even now, decades later, I am still discovering subtler layers of it.

---

## Ch 7a: conspiracy

- As you see this, you begin to perceive the world in an entirely new light.

- Some words take on new meanings. For example, "judgment" is another word that, like compassion, has been repurposed by evil.
  - If it simply means wise discernment of right from wrong, then of course we should judge.
  - But we don't stop there. We sneak in disdain and condescension. We tell ourselves that this doesn't sully our motivation to judge, which comes from a good place.
  - But as we saw, it doesn't just sully it; it produces the opposite effect.

- Another such word is outrage. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention, right? Right! _If_ outrage means virtuous anger directed at correcting injustice. But we tend to supplement it with self-righteous indignation. Another obvious way for our darkness to hitch a ride.

- Similarly, revenge fantasies like The Equalizer are seen to be manifestations of our evil. If you haven't seen those movies, they're about a righteous badass who goes on vengeful killing sprees, laying waste to comically one-dimensional villains. This is a painfully obvious attempt to reinforce our sanctimony. It is evil.

- In the same vein are those videos of "Karens getting owned." Nothing is more satisfying than watching an adult who's acting like a petulant child get wrecked. That is, until you become aware of what is actually happening in your mind to make you feel that way.

- In fact, any time you feel compelled to perceive the world in terms of good guys and bad guys; victims and perpetrators, it is the darkness asserting control.
  - Again, it's not that those roles don't exist. It's that when we use them to justify malice, it's an unmistakable sign that we have fallen into our shadow.
  - There are countless genuinely well-intentioned political movements that have fallen victim to this trap. Perhaps you can think of some.
  - When we witness an injustice, it is hard not to hate the perpetrator.
  - It helps to understand why and how this actually empowers more evil. Why it _is_ evil.

- In fact, this is how political rivalry escalates into civil war, without anyone being consciously aware of their role in bringing it about. Everyone believes they were helping, by being nasty to the bad guys.

---

## Conspiracy

- People have begun to question whether the folks across the aisle are truly our enemies, or if we're all secretly being played against each other by our real enemies, the elites.

- But however true that may be, ultimately we _and_ the elites are actually being played by something far more sinister.

- See, your evil is not actually separate from mine.

- This is hard to describe, but they're actually more like limbs of a single distributed super-organism.

- The evil in me actively seeks out the evil in you not to fight it but to secretly rejoin forces with it, by making us act in the ways I've described.

- In this way, human minds form a vast network by which this shadowy organism communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold.

- It is leveraging our collective intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that no one of us claims to want, yet which are the inevitable result of our combined self-deception.

- This is the conspiracy I alluded to earlier: a shadowy collective responsible for all the mayhem in the world, which nobody can see. And we are its unwitting minions.
 
- Every time any one of us feels malice, contempt, or self-righteousness toward _anyone_ — no matter how guilty they are, or what they are guilty of — we are secretly feeding this organism. 
  - This continual activity ensures that we remain trapped in a world system in which malicious hypocrites run the show.
  - Or rather, _appear_ to run the show, since they too are minions of our collective shadow.
  - It is as though the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing. Consciously, we may be fighting against the evil system, but part of our mind is secretly reinforcing it.
  - Under this dynamic, no matter how many "evil people" we string up, more will necessarily take their place.

- Once you see this, you can't un-see it: a society in which cruelty is increasingly noble, not realizing that this is the source of what we think we are fighting. It's completely heartbreaking.

- **But the craziest thing was discovering that I'm not actually an _unwitting_ minion. Part of my mind has always known that this is how it works. I just _pretend_ not to see it, so that I don't have to change.**

- I am a profound hypocrite. I have no leg to stand on.

- So nothing in this talk should be misconstrued as suggesting that I am in any way better than anyone. My only purpose is to share what I have seen.

- Your enemy is not other people. That's just an insanely clever illusion. Your enemy is the parasite in their minds, which is also the parasite in yours.

- But even that is not the ultimate truth. This organism is not what it appears to be.

---

## Ch 9: psychedelics

- Psychedelics can be a fantastic way to show you all of this. Eat enough mushrooms, and you will be shown, in painstaking detail, how every act of unkindness you ever committed contributed to a world that you then turned around and contemptuously judged. 
- We like to believe that our tiny misdeeds are lost to the winds of time, but the conscience never forgets.
- The word "psychedelic" means mind-manifesting. In a trip, your conscience may manifest as God. In a sense, they are the same archetype, and they indeed transcend what you think of as the world and your individual self.
- That God may condemn you to a visceral and completely convincing experience of hell, where you are tortured for all of eternity. You try to feign ignorance, but God isn't so easily fooled. You are transported back in time and shown that you knew of your self-deception, even while pretending that you didn't.
- God almost seems vengeful. But at the end of eternity, he has a giant surprise for you. It turns out you were Him all along, pretending that you weren't. You may then be taken through every incarnation of human existence; you live the lives of everybody. No wonder you had to be self-deceptive to harm them. They were all you.
- You were that Karen who got owned. You didn't want to become that person. Nobody could want that. It's only possible when the mind is contorted in an extremely painful way. You were also the one cruelly laughing at her. You knew that you were taking perverse pleasure in seeing someone get pushed deeper into their miserable pain. That, too, was only possible because your mind was distorted by unrecognized trauma.
- After going through all the iterations of humanity; being every victim and every perpetrator, and witnessing the heartbreaking tragedy of it all, you are then dropped into an endless ocean of perfect love, which is actually what you are. You're not merely forgiven; you see that you never actually committed the sins that you just imprisoned yourself for.
- The only mistake you ever made was forgetting who (or what) you actually are. 
  - From this innocent mistake arose the fear that you might not be good. 
  - Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, and had to dream up an entire physical reality of victims and perpetrators.
  - You then had to vanquish the latter to prove your own goodness and return Home.
  - But part of you felt guilty for doing so, because deep down you knew what you were actually doing.
  - To cover up this guilt, you had to project even harder.
  - Thus began an endless cycle of violence which continues to this day.
- You see that you could have skipped all that heartache by just coming home directly.
- You are then returned to your usual bozo self, where you are given the chance to try again, now equipped with the astonishing truth.
  - Unfortunately, it fades quickly, but not without a lasting imprint of what you just witnessed. What you just were. What you still are, and which nothing could ever truly take from you.


- When we lose sight of our true nature as absolute goodness, we are forced to seek it relatively. That is, at the expense of others. 
  - That is the ultimate source of our darkness.
  - It is merely trying to help us get back to our original goodness, but it mistakenly does this by making other people bad.
  - In this state, we cannot help but produce more evil, and then hide this fact from ourselves with increasing cleverness.
  - That is why every step you take toward remembering your true nature is a step toward ending evil.
  - The ultimate goal of meditation is a state in which you no longer produce evil.
  - A state in which you remember that you are everyone and everything.
- To get a taste of that astonishing remembrance, check out Thích Nhất Hạnh's poem _Please Call Me By My True Names._
- All the evil that was ever committed ultimately boils down to one simple misperception. Evil began life as an innocent mistake, with no real substance. But it quickly spiraled _wildly_ out of control, and took on a life of its own, to the point where it now seems insane to say that it has no real substance.
- Yet, in truth, it doesn't. Our misperception that evil is a real thing that lives in the mind of others is a self-perpetuating trick that keeps it alive.
- This limbo it occupies between real and unreal is what makes it so tricky to convey, and to heal. Our task is to see its true nature as delusion, and to discover its origin within our own minds.
- All beings are simply trying to return Home. May we be of service in helping them get back.

## Ch 10: quotes

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* — Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* — Carl Jung, 1975

> *I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I was them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self-deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them… [But] the judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source, but then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.*

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
>
> — Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner

Making a big show about hating the perpetrators and loving the victims.

That is the only reason that self-righteousness, contempt, and malice exist: to secretly create conditions where we get to feel more of those things.

- Herd immunity.

- Evil never actually fights evil.

- Your enemy is not other people.
