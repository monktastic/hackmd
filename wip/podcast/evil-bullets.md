## Intro

In 2008, while on a three-month self-led mostly-silent meditation retreat at a Tibetan center in the Rockies, I uncovered a massive global evil conspiracy that is responsible for all the horrors of the world. But that was nothing compared to the horrible discovery that I was one of its card-carrying members.

That gave me a tiny bit of insight into how to bring it down from the inside, which I'd like to share. Toward the end, I'll explain the role that I think psychedelics can play in this transformation.

I'll start by talking about the nature of evil.

---

## Ch 1: evil

- Evil is insanely clever, and its greatest trick is to cause us to overlook its presence within our own minds. 
 
- To the degree that we do see it, we believe it's there to give us the edge we need to fight the "real evil" out there.
 
- It hides our own hypocrisy from us while making us highly sensitive to it in others. 

- When we do become aware of our own, we excuse it.

- That's because our evil has us convinced that we are fundamentally good, unlike them. Therefore, we don't have to play by the same rules.
  - We can safely engage in behaviors that we wouldn't tolerate in others, because we are doing it to _fight_ evil, whereas they do it because they _are_ evil.
  - We can also let our guard down, because we could never slide down the slippery slope and become evil ourselves.

- But that belief is itself the clearest sign that it has already infected the deepest aspect of our mind.

- Evil is like a distributed organism, with control centers in each of our minds. As such, it is playing a game at a higher level than any of us are individually aware of.

- Yet, part of our mind is always able to perceive this game in its horrific entirety.

- All evil has to do to win is to prevent us from looking. And right now, it is kicking our asses.

---

## Ch 2: self-deception

- The deepest aspect of our mind knows right from wrong. That's our conscience—not to be confused with our consciousness.
 
- We sometimes act against our conscience: we do things that deep down we feel are wrong, but we don't let this knowledge into our conscious minds. Instead, our minds concoct a very clever cover story in which what we're doing is righteous. This is self-deception.

- All the evil in the world ultimately boils down to some form of self-deception, but we rarely recognize it as such. We don't see in others a more extreme form of something that we ourselves are engaged in; we believe we're looking at a different phenomenon entirely.

- We don't see a person who, like us, is fundamentally decent, but deluded. We perceive a fundamentally "bad person." Someone morally defective, unlike us. Our political opponents are an obvious example.

- Because we're decent people, we may first try to correct them before escalating to emotional and then maybe physical violence. But part of us knows that it's pointless to try and fix a broken person, so our attempts are half-hearted at best: less correction and more condescension. 

- Yet we already know that this isn't going to work, and so we're already prepping for the inevitable escalation. We act dismayed, but part of us secretly wants things to escalate.

- Your conscience can actually perceive that this person is ultimately just like you, and neither deserving of, nor helped by, contempt.

- Yet we don't listen to our conscience. We refuse to believe that this disgusting person is anything like us. So we turn away from our conscience, and pretend not to hear it. The only place left to turn is toward our darkness.
 
- Our darkness causes us to perceive a person worthy of contempt. This way, it can create a compelling cover story in which being cruel is not just okay, but positively righteous. That way, it can create mayhem in the name of good.

- But part of us always knows that this is what we're secretly doing. It is self-deception.

- We believe we're fighting their evil with our righteousness, but actually we're trying to fight their self-deception with our own.

- This cannot work. Self-deception cannot fight self-deception; it can only amplify it. Another way to say this is that evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, so that it can create more of itself, under the guise of good.

---

## Ch 3: compassion

- The only real solution to this problem is compassion.

- Now, that word probably evokes images of being soft, gentle, nice. And while those are surely fine qualities, they're worse than useless against evil. 

- But that's not at all what compassion actually means. Our darkness has just convinced us that it is, so that we will write it off, and fail to discover the one thing that can actually end it.

- **In truth, compassion can be as fierce or potentially even violent as necessary.** 

- The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. There's nothing nice about that. But in what sense is it compassionate?

- Compassion is the realization that at the deepest level, all you really want is for everything to feel totally okay, and that this is what everyone else wants, too (despite clear appearance to the contrary). 

- But it's not enough to simply _believe_ this. If you look at a Hitler and think oh, poor guy just wants to feel better, well, that's not going to end well.

- There must be an authentic perception of the true nature of reality for the compassion to be genuine. Only then can it serve the purpose of defeating evil.

---

## Ch 4: your true nature

- You see, reality is actually one seamless whole which you only appear to be separate from. This illusion of separateness is called the ego, and it is our normal mode of operation. But below that level, certain universal truths can be glimpsed.

- In particular, you discover that the nature of mind is intrinsically compassionate. It's what you most fundamentally are. But we quickly forget this. Then, having lost contact with our _absolute_ goodness, we have to settle for _relative_ goodness.

- This is a good that requires other people to be bad. In other words, our ego _needs_ bad people to exist in order to maintain its self-perception as good.

- But we can't just go about creating bad people in an obvious way, because that would destroy our self-image.

- So our ego must go about doing this in an underhanded way. We seek out people who we can reasonably label bad, and then find ways to harm them, because we know that this will make them a little worse.

- Of course, we must never admit to ourselves that we're doing this, which is why this idea probably strikes you as preposterous.

- This is the origin of self-deception. Our inability to perceive our absolute goodness forces us to seek it relatively. From there, we quickly end up lost in a maze of projections.

- When you rediscover the true nature of your own mind, you automatically perceive it in all others. You discover the ultimate source of their misbehavior. You also see what is required to undo it.

- This is the only way to truly reduce the evil in the world, instead of unwittingly amplifying it.

---

## Ch 5: hurt people

- We are all familiar with the example of how "hurt people hurt people."

- When we are made to feel unworthy of love, it hurts so much that we can't bear to face it. We think "How could a fundamentally decent person like me be made to feel this way? And why isn't anyone trying to help? What a cruel world. If the world won't give me the simple comfort that I need, well, who can blame me for taking it myself?"

- Meanwhile, the rest of us don't perceive a fundamentally decent person trying to get the love they desperately need; we simply perceive a bad person. Because if we were in their shoes, we wouldn't be crying out for help by doing bad things. We would simply pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, or else at least ask nicely, like a decent person.

- Therefore, it is our moral duty to remind them of how awful they are. We don't see that this is self-deception, and that pushing them further from love is actually just an attempt to elevate ourselves; that it's not designed to improve the world like we pretend.

- Again, being compassionate doesn't mean being nice to them. It just means gaining authentic insight into the hidden causes of their misbehavior instead of mindlessly acting from ego. We may still have to deliver tough love, but the crucial point is that it is a form of love. From the outside, it may not look anything like love, but we know the difference from the inside.

- It may not seem like this change in intention matters much, but it makes all the difference in the world. **Every act of self-deception, no matter how small or carefully disguised, creates more self-deception in the world. And contempt is always a sign of self-deception. Conversely, every action that's compassionate — that is, free of such deception, will heal this tendency, and thus reduce evil.**

- This sounds like a belief, but it is actually a perception that develops as we discover the true nature of our minds.

- Learning to distinguish which of our motivations are genuinely benevolent and which are egoic is central to the fight against evil. Without this, part of your mind will be secretly conspiring with the darkness instead of fighting it.

## Ch 6: meditation

- As an aside, this helps explain why even breathing meditation can be effective at inducing kindness. It helps you become aware of what your mind is doing.

- Let me use an analogy. Have you ever been reading a book, only to realize that your eyes are still scanning the page while your mind is doing something else entirely?

- What was happening during that zone-out? Were you conscious or unconscious? 
  - On one hand, if I had interrupted your reverie and asked what you were thinking about, you could have told me. So you weren't unconscious. 
  - On the other hand, you weren't aware of what your mind was doing. That's why it felt like an "oops" when you finally realized it.

- This is a kind of limbo state, which we occupy far more often than we realize. It took me weeks of full time meditation to begin to notice that almost my entire life had been spent in that pseudo-conscious state. Until you see it for yourself, this is very hard to believe.

- Your darkness uses that liminal space to encourage your mind to go down dark roads that you might otherwise not be willing to drive down. Therefore, closing those mindless gaps is the first step in ending one's self-deception.

- Meditation, in this context, is simply becoming aware of what your mind is actually doing. Following the breath is like reading a book. At some point you will notice oops, I was distracted. Each time this happens, you gain a little insight into why you zone out, and it happens less and less.

- As a result, you become more present in life, and it is correspondingly easier to hear the voice of your conscience, and much harder to pretend that you don't.

- So meditation doesn't _produce_ kindness by altering your moral beliefs; it simply makes you more aware of which voice you're actually following.

- As you follow this rabbit hole deeper, you discover that you haven't always been following the voice that you thought you were. And neither has most of the rest of world.

---

## Ch 7a: conspiracy

- As you see this, you begin to perceive the world in an entirely new light.

- You see how political rivalry escalates into civil war, without anyone being consciously aware of their role in bringing it about. Everyone believes they were fixing the problem by being nasty to the bad guys. We were just fighting evil.

- You see how the most evil people (so to speak) can do what they do without feeling remorse. In a very real sense, they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. Of course, some part of them absolutely does know. But another part is carefully hiding this from conscious self-reflection.
  - Until you have seen clearly how your own darkness keeps large aspects of your mind hidden from you, it's impossible to recognize what's actually happening in them, and thus, to do anything genuinely useful about it.
  - Now, I don't mean to oversimplify the problem. In many cases, people's darkness is so entrenched that attempting to be compassionate can actually backfire. That's not because compassion was the wrong approach; it's because we haven't developed sufficient insight to be genuinely compassionate. We're probably just being nice. This is sometimes called idiot compassion.
  - It also takes wisdom to employ our compassion effectively. That is the work of a lifetime or lifetimes. I have a long way to go here.
  - But what I do know is that this a particularly important time to be aware of my tendency to become self-righteous and malicious. Because the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the more profound the evil, the greater the risk of my doing that without realizing it.

## Ch 7b

- Perhaps the most astonishing you may discover is how humanity managed to create a system that allows a small handful of greedy sociopaths to destroy our world despite the vast majority of us seemingly fighting against it.
  - It happened because our darkness needed there to be easily-identifiable bad guys on whom we could pin the blame, so that we would never have to confront our own misdeeds. So we unconsciously architected a system in which such people have to exist. 
  - **Such a system will continue to run the world for as long as we avoid owning up to our own contribution. It is completely inevitable.**
  - To be clear, I am not blaming us _instead_ of them. **But I have been forcibly shown with terrifying precision how every tiny act of unkindness that I've perpetrated on this world was secretly designed to create people that I could then turn around and blame everything on.**
  - Earlier I said we "unconsciously" architected it, but that's not entirely accurate. The biggest shock was discovering that part of me knew exactly what I was doing, even as I was doing it. **I _chose_ to turn away.** Nothing could be more painful than being shown what a complete and utter hypocrite I am.
  - There IS a secret evil global conspiracy responsible for all the horrors of the world, and part of my own mind has always been in on it.

  - The people who I normally think of as pulling the strings are caught in the very same trap. They aren't _more_ aware of their roles in it. To the contrary, they can only effectively fulfill those roles because their self-deception is more effective at hiding it from them.
  - I'm not defending them. It's not that they're _unaware_ of what they're doing; it's that their mind has concocted an insanely clever cover story that makes it appear okay.
  - When I see someone doing this, my instinct is to try to force them to admit it. And it's very hard not to feel contempt while doing so.
  - The problem is that contempt is an unmistakable sign that _I_ am lost in self-deception.
  - Their darkness will immediately latch onto that. And instead of my behavior helping them see _their_ hypocrisy, they will become fixated on mine — just like I do when a hypocrite tries to moralize me.
  - I can only make other people conscious of their self-deception to the degree that I am not expressing my own. Because then, theirs has nothing to latch onto. For a brief time, this robs it of its power, and there can be a moment of clarity. Their inner light (as it were) is able to shine through, briefly dispelling the clouds of delusion.
  - Before, your evil was secretly allied with theirs. Now, it's the opposite: your light is awakening theirs. On the surface, you may still be enemies, but underneath, you are beginning to fight the same battle — the one against delusion.
  - **That is why evil's greatest trick is to keep our attention fixated externally, on the evil "out there." This effectively prevents us from doing the inner work that could actually put an end to it.**

- Now, it would be insane for me to see all this and still harbor malice. Yet I often do. So nothing in this talk should be misconstrued as suggesting that I am in any way better than anyone. My only purpose is to share what I have seen.
- I believe that it will take the concerted effort of everyone who's concerned about the problem of evil doing this inner work to finally put an end to the madness.

## Ch 8: misc

- There are some supplementary points I'd like to make that didn't fit into the main narrative arc.

- The word judgment is another word that, like compassion, has been repurposed by evil. 
  - If judgment simply means wise discernment of right from wrong, then of course we should judge. 
  - But we don't stop there. We sneak in contempt and condescension. We tell ourselves that this doesn't sully our motivation to judge, which comes from a good place.
  - But it does sully it. As we saw, it produces exactly the opposite effect. And part of us intends this.

- Another such word is outrage. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention, right? Right! _If_ outrage means virtuous anger directed at correcting injustice. But we tend not to leave it at that. We usually bring in self-righteous indignation. This is our darkness hitching an easy ride.

- Similarly, revenge fantasies like The Equalizer are actually manifestations of our evil. If you haven't seen those movies, they're about a righteous badass who goes on vengeful killing sprees, laying waste to comically one-dimensional villains. The purpose of such movies is to give voice to our collective shadow, and, to the degree that they successfully trigger the sanctimony that they're obviously designed to induce, they just push us further into our self-delusion.

- In the same vein are those videos of "Karens getting owned." Nothing is more satisfying than watching an adult who's acting like a petulant child get wrecked. That is, unless you are free of darkness, in which case there's nothing pleasurable about it. It's just heartbreaking. Those videos exist only to reinforce our darkness (which, admittedly, I am not exactly free of).

- In fact, any time you feel compelled to perceive the world in terms of good guys and bad guys; victims and perpetrators, this is the darkness trying to colonize your mind. Of course in any given situation there might actually be one side at fault and another less so. The mistake comes in seeing these roles as intrinsic as opposed to shifting with conditions. That victim may turn around and become the perpetrator. In fact, to the degree that they perceive themselves as an inherent victim, and their oppressor as intrinsically bad, such a reversal of roles is all but guaranteed. That's practically human history in a nutshell, and we should not be supporting it.

- Again, perceiving darkness in another person's mind is a blaring signal that your darkness is trying to take control of yours. Please watch out.

- Finally, it is said that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." That depends on what we mean by intentions. The intentions of your conscience do not lead to hell. It is only when filtered through our egos, where we _believe_ we're doing good, that this leads to hell.

## Ch 9: psychedelics

- Psychedelics are a fantastic way to show you this. Eat enough mushrooms, and you will be shown, in painstaking detail, how every act of unkindness you ever committed contributed to a world that you then turned around and contemptuously judged. 
- We like to believe that our tiny misdeeds are lost to the winds of time, but the conscience never forgets.
- The word "psychedelic" means mind-manifesting. In a trip, your conscience may manifest as God. In a sense, they are the same archetype, and they indeed transcend what you think of as the world and your individual self.
- That God may condemn you to a visceral and completely convincing experience of hell, where you are tortured for all of eternity. You try to feign ignorance, but God isn't so easily fooled. You are transported back in time and shown that you knew of your self-deception, even while pretending that you didn't.
- God almost seems vengeful. But at the end of eternity, he has a giant surprise for you. It turns out you were Him all along, pretending that you weren't. You may then be taken through every incarnation of human existence; you live the lives of everybody. No wonder you had to be self-deceptive to harm them. They were all you.
- You were that Karen who got owned. You didn't want to become that person. Nobody could want that. It's only possible when the mind is contorted in an extremely painful way. You were also the one laughing at her. You knew that you were taking pleasure in seeing her get pushed deeper into her pain. That, too, was only possible because your mind was distorted by unhealed trauma.
- After going through all the iterations of humanity, and witnessing the heartbreaking tragedy of it all, you are then dropped into an endless ocean of perfect love, which is actually what you are. You're not merely forgiven; you see that you never actually committed the sins that you just imprisoned yourself for.
- The only mistake you ever made was forgetting who (or what) you actually are. From this innocent mistake arose the fear that you might not be good. Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, and had to dream up an entire physical reality of victims and perpetrators. You then had to vanquish the latter to prove your own goodness and return Home. But part of you felt guilty for doing so, because deep down you knew that they didn't deserve this. To cover up this guilt, you had to project even harder. Thus began an endless cycle which to this day you struggle to escape.
- You see that you could have skipped all that heartache by just coming home directly. 
- You are then returned to your usual bozo self, where you are given the chance to try again, now equipped with the astonishing truth.
- It is impossible to communicate the profundity of this realization. It can occur on psychedelics, but also during totally sober meditation. To get a taste of it, read Thich Nhat Hanh's poem _Call Me By My True Names._
- You see that all the evil that was ever committed boils down to one simple misperception. Evil began life as an innocent mistake, with no real substance. But it quickly spiraled _wildly_ out of control, and took on a life of its own, to the point where it now seems insane to say that it has no real substance.
- Yet, in truth, it doesn't. Our misperception that evil is a real thing that lives in the mind of others is a self-perpetuating trick that keeps it alive.
- This limbo it occupies between real and unreal is what makes it so tricky to convey, and to heal. Our task is to see its true nature as delusion, and to discover its source within our own minds. Without seeing that, we can't help but be its unwitting minions.
- All beings are simply trying to return home. May we be of service in helping them get there.

## Ch 10: quotes

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* — Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* — Carl Jung, 1975

> *I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I was them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self-deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them… [But] the judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source, but then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.*

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
>
> — Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner

Social norms?
