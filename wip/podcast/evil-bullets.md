## Intro

In 2008, while on a three-month self-led mostly-silent meditation retreat at a Tibetan center in the Rockies, I uncovered a massive global evil conspiracy that is responsible for all the horrors of the world. But that was nothing compared to the horrible discovery that I was one of its card-carrying members.

That gave me a tiny bit of insight into how to bring it down from the inside, which I'd like to share. Toward the end, I'll explain the role that I think psychedelics can play in this transformation.

Allow me to build up to that. I'll start by talking about the nature of evil.

---

## Ch 1: evil

- Evil is insanely clever, and its greatest trick is to cause us to overlook its presence within our own minds. 
  - To the extent that we do see it, we believe it's there to help us fight the "real evil" out there.
 
- It hides our own hypocrisy from us while making us highly sensitive to it in others. We excuse our own, while condemning it in others.

- That's because our evil has us convinced that we are fundamentally good, unlike them. Therefore, we don't have to play by the same rules.
  - We can safely engage in behaviors that we wouldn't tolerate in others, because we are doing it to _fight_ evil, whereas they do it because they _are_ evil.
  - We can also let our guard down. We don't have to worry about sliding down the slippery slope and becoming evil, because that could only happen to bad people.

- But that belief is itself the most reliable indicator that it has already infected the deepest aspect of our mind.

- Its whole game is to prevent us from seeing the full extent of our complicity in the horrors of the world.

- If it can keep the whole world playing its game, it wins. And right now, it is kicking our asses.

---

## Ch 2: self-deception

- The deepest aspect of our mind knows right from wrong. That's our conscience—not to be confused with our consciousness.
 
- We sometimes act against our conscience: we do things that deep down we feel are wrong, but we don't let this knowledge into our conscious minds. Instead, our minds concoct a very clever cover story in which what we're doing is okay. This is self-deception.

- All the evil in the world ultimately boils down to some form of self-deception, but we rarely recognize it as such. We don't see in others a more extreme form of something that we ourselves are engaged in; we believe we're looking at a different phenomenon entirely.

- We don't see a person who, like us, is fundamentally decent, but flawed. We perceive a fundamentally "bad person." Someone morally defective, unlike us. Think about your political opponents.

- Because we're decent people, we may first try to correct them before escalating to emotional and then perhaps physical violence. But part of us knows that it's pointless to try and fix a broken person, so our attempts are half-hearted at best: less correction and more condescension. 

- Yet we already know that this isn't going to work, and so we're already prepping for the inevitable escalation. We act dismayed, but part of us secretly wants things to escalate.

- Your conscience can actually perceive that this person is ultimately just like you, and neither deserving of, nor helped by, contempt.

- But the darkness in your mind cleverly prevents you from seeing this. It causes you to perceive a "bad person"; someone whom it is your duty to treat with contempt. It knows that this will provoke escalation — and that is what it actually wants.

- This behavior will cause everyone — you, your victim, your allies, bystanders — to become slightly nastier and more self-deceptive people.

- Whatever temporary positive effects may result, the world becomes a little darker.

- But you won't be able to see this. Your darkness will ensure that all you see is a win. Any negative effects can be blamed entirely on your evil enemy. You were only fighting evil, and how could that ever be wrong?


- It is really worth pausing to feel how compelling that story is. How natural it is to feel contempt for bad people. How obviously righteous it is. How nobody can convince you otherwise — and if they try, well, _they're_ probably evil.

- Because part of your mind knows unequivocally that this story is a sham; that such behavior doesn't actually serve the purpose it pretends to. Yet it is so incredibly alluring.
 

- This is how our darkness masquerades as our conscience.

- If you can see just this one thing with complete clarity, you will understand the secret trick behind all the evil there ever was. And you will discover the only way to end it.

[//]: # (- Evil never actually fights evil; it only pretends to, in order to create more of itself with our unwitting assistance.)

---

## Ch 3: compassion

- If you think I'm going to tell you to be nice, think again. The problem isn't that you were being mean, it's that you were being self-deceptive.

- Part of you knew, even as you were doing it, that you were acting against your conscience. Because when we're acting in alignment with our deepest values, contempt and self-righteousness are actually impossible.

- No matter how well you hide this self-deception, people can always sense it, even if only subconsciously. And it invites their minds to do the same.


- The opposite of self-deception is compassion.

- That word probably evokes images of people being nice and sweet. Those are surely fine qualities, but they are worse than useless against evil.
 
- But that is not what compassion means. It is our darkness that tries to make us think that it is, so that we will write it off, and fail to discover the one thing that can actually kill it. 
  - Part of our duty must be to reclaim that word.

- **Compassion can be as fierce or potentially even violent as the situation requires.** 

- The Dalai Lama was once asked what you should do if a gunman is trying to kill you and you have a gun. He said, well, shoot back. There's nothing nice about that. But in what sense is it compassionate?

- Compassion is the realization that at the deepest level, all you really want is for everything to feel totally okay, and that this is what everyone else wants, too (despite obvious appearance to the contrary). 

- But it's not enough to simply _believe_ this. If you look at a Hitler and think oh, poor guy just wants to feel better, well, that's not going to end well.

- There must be an authentic perception of the true nature of reality for the compassion to be genuine. Only then can it serve the purpose of defeating evil.

---

## Ch 4: your true nature

- You see, reality is actually one seamless whole which you only appear to be separate from. This illusion of separateness is called the ego, and it is our normal mode of operation. But below that level, certain universal truths can be glimpsed.

- In particular, you discover that the nature of mind is intrinsically compassionate. It's what you most fundamentally are.

- And this isn't just true of your mind; it's a truth about minds in general. You may wonder how it's possible to discover truths about other people's minds, and the short answer is that they're not truly other. It's... hard to explain.

- Maybe the simplest way to convey this is that when a mind is completely clear and unconfused at its very deepest levels, it has no use for malice. It perceives the incredible beauty of reality and naturally desires to contribute to it.

- Being separated from our true nature is intrinsically painful, and humans do the darndest things to try and get back.

- For example, we know that "hurt people hurt people."

- If you understand this saying, it's because you've learned to perceive something about people. 
  - You see how pain can lead to misbehavior, even when that connection is far from obvious. Their misbehavior is an extremely well-disguised cry for help.
  - Now, the more well-disguised it becomes, the less we are able to consciously recognize it as such.
  - Except this isn't quite true, either. It's not that we're less _able_ to perceive it. It's that the less it conventionally looks like a cry for help, the more our darkness realizes that it can use this as an excuse to cause more harm with plausible deniability.

- For example, we might think well, I was hurt, and I turned out okay. There must be something wrong with the ones who didn't, so they don't deserve my compassion. But if you feel this way, then perhaps you did not, in fact, turn out okay. 
  - This is not a judgement of you. We are all hurt people who hurt people.

- If you make contact with the true nature of your mind, however briefly, you perceive this directly. It is the ultimate source of literally all misbehavior.

---

## Ch 5

- But as we saw before, sometimes hurting bad people is the right thing to do. How do we know _when_ it is right?

- It comes down to whether it's done from compassion or self-deception.

- Remember, being compassionate doesn't mean being nice. It just means having authentic insight into the hidden causes of misbehavior. From this perception, sometimes what people need really is a swift kick in the ass, or worse.
  - The difference is that it won't feel malicious in the slightest bit. There is no perception that they are intrinsically bad, and no pleasure in making them suffer.
  - You won't get that righteous hit of fighting evil. It's a much more wholesome joy of watching delusion evaporate from this world.

- It may not seem like this change in intention matters much, but it makes all the difference in the world. One of those behaviors leads to a downward spiral. The other leads to a virtuous spiral.

- That's because people are ridiculously sensitive to our true intentions, even if only subconsciously.
 
- You can mock or shame someone with malice, or with compassion, and though the two may look almost identical, the ultimate result will be wildly different.

- If you do it via compassion, part of them can sense that you're someone who can be trusted at the deepest level—even if their conscious mind isn't ready to admit it yet. Their fundamental goodness recognizes yours as an ally. 
  - Your words will therefore deeply penetrate their minds and gnaw away at their self-deception. 
  - A seed has been planted. Not only in their minds, but also that of bystanders.

- On the other hand, if your behavior is malicious, everyone can sense this too, and it will have the opposite effect.


- Now, it is said that "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." This does not refer to genuine compassion, but those intentions that we pretend are good.

- That is why it is so crucial to gain skill in recognizing our true motivations. 
  - We have a ridiculously strong tendency to deceive ourselves about them.

## Ch 6: meditation

- As an aside, this helps explain why even breathing meditation can be effective at inducing kindness. It helps you become aware of what your mind is actually doing.

- Let me use an analogy. Have you ever been reading a book, only to realize that your eyes are still scanning the page while your mind is doing something else entirely?

- Were you conscious or unconscious during that time? 
  - On one hand, if I had interrupted your reverie and asked what you were thinking about, you could have told me, because you were conscious.
  - On the other hand, you weren't aware that you were doing it. That's why it felt like an "oops" when you realized it.

- This should astonish you. You are capable of doing things with full consciousness yet without knowing that you're doing them.

- In this case, it was easy to bring those thoughts into the light of self-reflective awareness. But it is not always so easy. 
  - It is a variation of this state that allows people to be self-deceptive, and you cannot simply shake them out of it, for the same reason that nobody has succeeded in shaking you out of it. The defense mechanisms run deep.

- Such limbo states happen far more often than we realize. 
- It took me weeks of full time meditation to begin to notice them in myself. I wouldn't have believed you if you had told me before.

- Meditation, in this context, is simply becoming aware of what your mind is actually doing. Following the breath is like reading a book. At some point you will notice oops, I was distracted. Each time this happens, you gain a little more insight into how your mind tricks you into zoning out.

- As a result, you become more present in life, and it is correspondingly easier to hear the voice of your conscience, and much harder to pretend that you don't.

- So meditation doesn't _produce_ kindness by altering your moral beliefs; it simply makes you more aware of which voice you're actually following.

- It is horrifying to discover that you haven't always been following the voice that you thought you were.

---

## Ch 7a: conspiracy

- As you see this, you begin to perceive the world in an entirely new light.

- You see how political rivalry escalates into civil war, without anyone being consciously aware of their role in bringing it about. Everyone believes they were fixing the problem by being nasty to the bad guys, although part of them knew what was actually happening.

- You see how the most evil people can do the terrible things they do without feeling remorse. In a very real sense, they don't know that what they're doing is wrong. Of course, some part of them absolutely does know. But another part is carefully hiding this from conscious self-reflection.
  - And this isn't grounds for contempt, like it once seemed.
  - Until you have seen clearly how your own darkness has kept large aspects of your mind hidden from you, it's impossible to recognize what's actually happening in them.
  - Now, I don't mean to oversimplify the problem. In such cases, their darkness is so entrenched that attempting to be compassionate can actually backfire. 
  - That's not because compassion is the wrong approach; it's because we haven't developed sufficient insight to be genuinely compassionate in such difficult cases. We may just end up being nice, and we already know how well that works against evil.
  - It also takes wisdom to employ our compassion effectively. That is the work of a lifetime or lifetimes, and I am not especially skilled here.
  - But what I do know is that this a particularly important time to be alert for my tendency to become self-righteous and malicious. Because the only thing worse than letting evil win is secretly joining forces with it. And the more profound the evil, the greater the risk of my doing that without realizing it.


- The most painful thing I saw was what a complete and utter hypocrite I am, and how much of the world's ills can ultimately be traced back to my own behavior.
  - Instead of changing my behavior, I simply point at the people with more complicity, so that I don't have to change.
  - I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't find the points of greatest leverage.
  - It's just that if I look carefully enough, I can see how my resistance to personal change is secretly working against those structural changes.
  - It's not that I have to become completely virtuous before I can change the world. It's that I must become completely honest.

## Ch 7b

- The most shocking realization is how your darkness and mine aren't actually separate. 

- This is hard to describe, but they're actually more like limbs of a single distributed super-organism.

- The evil in me seeks out the evil in you not to fight it, but to join forces with it. 

- In this way, humans form a vast network by which this shadowy organism communicates with itself beneath our conscious threshold.

- It is leveraging our intelligence to produce horrifying outcomes that no individual would claim to want, yet which we, through our collective self-deception, are each secretly contributing to.

- This is the conspiracy I alluded to earlier. This collective evil is responsible for all the mayhem in the world, and it does this in a way that prevents anyone from ever suspecting it.

- You are literally feeding this organism every time you feel contempt or malice for any human being. 

- Your fight isn't really against other people, no matter how evil. It's against the parasite in their minds. And the only way to evict that parasite from their minds is to discover how it has infected yours. Otherwise, you cannot help but be its unwitting minion.

- The first time I saw this clearly, the biggest shock was discovering that I wasn't actually an unwitting participant. Part of me has always known that I've been in on this conspiracy to produce more evil.

- Every single act of unkindness I perpetrated on this world was knowingly feeding the beast. I just couldn't admit it to myself.

- I am a hypocrite. I have no leg to stand on when I blame other people for being evil.

- Nothing in this talk should be misconstrued as suggesting that I am in any way better than anyone. My only purpose is to share what I have seen, and here is the heart of it.

- Our mission is to kill this organism. 

- The more deeply you realize your true nature, the more deeply you can pierce the minds of others. 

---

- I can only make other people conscious of their self-deception to the degree that I am not expressing my own. Because then, theirs has nothing to latch onto. For a brief time, it is robbed of its power, and the person may have a moment of clarity. Their inner light (as it were) is able to shine through, briefly dispelling the clouds of delusion.
- Before, your evil was secretly allied with theirs. Now, it's the opposite: your light is awakening theirs. On the surface, you may still be enemies, but underneath, you are beginning to fight the same battle — the one against delusion.
- **That is why evil's greatest trick is to keep our attention fixated externally, on the evil "out there." This effectively prevents us from doing the inner work that could actually put an end to it.**

- I believe that it will take the concerted effort of everyone who's concerned about the problem of evil doing this inner work to finally put an end to the madness.

---

## Ch 8: misc

- There are some supplementary points I'd like to make that didn't fit into the main narrative arc.

- The word judgment is another word that, like compassion, has been repurposed by evil. 
  - If judgment simply means wise discernment of right from wrong, then of course we should judge. 
  - But we don't stop there. We sneak in disdain and condescension. We tell ourselves that this doesn't sully our motivation to judge, which comes from a good place.
  - But it does sully it. As we saw, it produces exactly the opposite effect. And part of us intends this.

- Another such word is outrage. If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention, right? Right! _If_ outrage means virtuous anger directed at correcting injustice. But we tend not to leave it at that. We usually bring in self-righteous indignation. This is our darkness hitching an easy ride.

- Similarly, revenge fantasies like The Equalizer are actually manifestations of our evil. If you haven't seen those movies, they're about a righteous badass who goes on vengeful killing sprees, laying waste to comically one-dimensional villains. The purpose of such movies is to give voice to our collective shadow, and, to the degree that they successfully trigger the sanctimony that they're obviously designed to induce, they just push us further into our self-delusion.

- In the same vein are those videos of "Karens getting owned." Nothing is more satisfying than watching an adult who's acting like a petulant child get wrecked. That is, unless you are free of darkness, in which case there's nothing pleasurable about it. It's just heartbreaking. Those videos exist only to reinforce our darkness (which, admittedly, I am not exactly free of).

- In fact, any time you feel compelled to perceive the world in terms of good guys and bad guys; victims and perpetrators, this is the darkness trying to colonize your mind. Of course in any given situation there might actually be one side at fault and another less so. The mistake comes in seeing these roles as intrinsic as opposed to shifting with conditions. That victim may turn around and become the perpetrator. In fact, to the degree that they perceive themselves as an inherent victim, and their oppressor as intrinsically bad, such a reversal of roles is all but guaranteed. That's practically human history in a nutshell, and we should not be supporting it.

- Again, perceiving darkness in another person's mind is a blaring signal that your darkness is trying to take control of yours. Please watch out.

## Ch 9: psychedelics

- Psychedelics are a fantastic way to show you this. Eat enough mushrooms, and you will be shown, in painstaking detail, how every act of unkindness you ever committed contributed to a world that you then turned around and contemptuously judged. 
- We like to believe that our tiny misdeeds are lost to the winds of time, but the conscience never forgets.
- The word "psychedelic" means mind-manifesting. In a trip, your conscience may manifest as God. In a sense, they are the same archetype, and they indeed transcend what you think of as the world and your individual self.
- That God may condemn you to a visceral and completely convincing experience of hell, where you are tortured for all of eternity. You try to feign ignorance, but God isn't so easily fooled. You are transported back in time and shown that you knew of your self-deception, even while pretending that you didn't.
- God almost seems vengeful. But at the end of eternity, he has a giant surprise for you. It turns out you were Him all along, pretending that you weren't. You may then be taken through every incarnation of human existence; you live the lives of everybody. No wonder you had to be self-deceptive to harm them. They were all you.
- You were that Karen who got owned. You didn't want to become that person. Nobody could want that. It's only possible when the mind is contorted in an extremely painful way. You were also the one laughing at her. You knew that you were taking pleasure in seeing her get pushed deeper into her pain. That, too, was only possible because your mind was distorted by unhealed trauma.
- After going through all the iterations of humanity, and witnessing the heartbreaking tragedy of it all, you are then dropped into an endless ocean of perfect love, which is actually what you are. You're not merely forgiven; you see that you never actually committed the sins that you just imprisoned yourself for.
- The only mistake you ever made was forgetting who (or what) you actually are. 
  - From this innocent mistake arose the fear that you might not be good. 
  - Instead of confronting that fear, you projected it outward, and had to dream up an entire physical reality of victims and perpetrators. 
  - You then had to vanquish the latter to prove your own goodness and return Home. 
  - But part of you felt guilty for doing so, because deep down you knew that they didn't deserve this. 
  - To cover up this guilt, you had to project even harder, creating increasingly terrible-seeming people. 
  - Thus began an endless cycle which to this day you struggle to escape.
- You see that you could have skipped all that heartache by just coming home directly. 
- You are then returned to your usual bozo self, where you are given the chance to try again, now equipped with the astonishing truth.
- It is impossible to communicate the profundity of this realization. It can occur on psychedelics, but also during totally sober meditation. To get a taste of it, read Thich Nhat Hanh's poem _Call Me By My True Names._
- You see that all the evil that was ever committed boils down to one simple misperception. Evil began life as an innocent mistake, with no real substance. But it quickly spiraled _wildly_ out of control, and took on a life of its own, to the point where it now seems insane to say that it has no real substance.
- Yet, in truth, it doesn't. Our misperception that evil is a real thing that lives in the mind of others is a self-perpetuating trick that keeps it alive.
- This limbo it occupies between real and unreal is what makes it so tricky to convey, and to heal. Our task is to see its true nature as delusion, and to discover its source within our own minds. Without seeing that, we can't help but be its unwitting minions.
- All beings are simply trying to return home. May we be of service in helping them get there.

## Ch 10: quotes

> _If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?_ —Alexander Solzhenitsyn

> *The shadow is a moral problem that challenges the whole ego-personality, for no one can become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it involves recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act is the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge.* — Carl Jung

> *Such a man knows that whatever is wrong in the world is also in himself, and if he only learns to deal with his own shadow, he has done something real for the world. He has succeeded in shouldering at least an infinitesimal part of the gigantic, unsolved problems of our day.* — Carl Jung, 1975

> *I wasn’t just watching the events; I was actually reliving them again, while at the same time I was also re-experiencing the actions from other people’s points of view. I was them. I was reliving the experience from their point of view and at the same time (and I don’t know how this works) I was also experiencing it from a higher reality; the truth of the matter. So what I saw was my own lies and my own self-deception to myself, which I had used to convince me that doing certain things was okay because people had deserved it. Then I was experiencing the emotional impact it had on other people. I felt their pain. I felt the shock on them… [But] the judgment came all from myself. It was not from an outside source, but then this being that was with me was also sending me comforting messages – thank goodness! – and one of them was it was alright as I was only human.*

> *My most recent mushroom trip (also the largest dose I've ever taken) I became fixated on a news story I had heard that week. About an 8 year old girl from a tribe in the Amazon, who was [tied to a tree and burned alive](https://www.survivalinternational.org/news/8033) in order to scare her people off their land so it could be logged. I realized that at the moment he did it, whoever lit that gasoline actually felt / thought more or less okay about what he was doing. **And my mind was illuminated with dozens of the parallels between that man's malformed, horrific perceptual / behavioral state, and mine. I saw the same mistakes in value attribution, the same willful ignorance of the consequences of my acts and words. And there was nothing I could do to deny the similarity.***
>
> *Reminds me of something (I think) Duncan [Trussell] said on some recent podcast, quoting somebody else: it isn't the victim of violence you have to pray for so much. It's the perpetrator. They are the one who is more trapped in delusion, more estranged from love, etc.*

> Even if I want to put this realization down I can’t. Sometimes it’s excruciating. You know those morons that rammed those planes into the World Trade Center? That was me. The people that died in the collapse. Me again. Every single person who ever paid money for a Pet Rock? Me. I don’t mean I identify with them or sympathize with them. I mean I _am_ them. It’s impossible to explain any more clearly than that, but this isn’t a figure of speech or bad poetry. I mean it absolutely literally.
>
> But the universe is sooooo much bigger than any of that. The sky is me, and the stars too, and the chirping crickets and the songs they make; sparkling rivers, snow and rain, distant solar systems and whatever beings may live there: it’s all me. And it’s you, too.
>
> — Zen priest (and punk rocker) Brad Warner

Social norms?

When we hear of a brutal crime, we often feel malice toward the perpetrator. Depraved.

Making a big show about hating the perpetrators.

That is the only reason that self-righteousness, contempt, and malice exist: to secretly create conditions where we get to feel more of those things.

Herd immunity.
