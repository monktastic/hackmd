We think that hating bad people is a sign of the good within us, but it's really a sign of the evil.

"Bad people" are only able to do what they do because of self-deception — the very same mechanism that enables our own misbehavior, if we're honest.

If you look closely enough, you'll find that hatred (and its little brother, contempt) exists only to enable you to generate more hatred in the world while feeling self-righteous about it. It is pure self-deception — the very thing you hate them for. The truth is that you see an aspect of yourself in them, and it's much easier to fight what's outside than what's inside. Unfortunately, this backfires miserably.

It is very hard to admit that we're doing this, but once we do, we finally begin to understand what makes it so hard for the "bad people" to recognize _their_ self-deception—and how our own behavior is secretly designed to make it even harder. Then we may discover that the whole world is locked in a cycle of gleefully shoving each other into the dark to avoid confronting the darkness within.

When this scheme is seen in its full horrific glory, it appears so diabolically clever that it almost seems intelligently designed. In a sense, it is. The biggest shock, however, is discovering that the "designer" lives within our own minds. 

We have always been in on the original "evil conspiracy," to which the rest ultimately owe their existence. Our greatest responsibility is to heal that part of ourselves. What remains is an impossibly fierce love for the world. It burns right through self-deception, and thus through evil.

This is the dawning of true compassion (aka kindness). We may still have to utilize anger, shaming, or even violence, but it is done with a completely different intention—which people can sense—and with much deeper insight into the true causes of misbehavior. It is in this sense that kindness is the correct orientation in literally every situation. It is not about being nice.

Before recognizing this, every attempt to "fight evil" is secretly an attempt to create more. I wish I could say that afterward, you magically become a "good person" who knows how to fight evil, but it's not true. All I know now is that I'm a profound hypocrite with a whole lot of work to do. I have no right to lecture anyone on morality. I just want to share what I've seen. Maybe you've seen it too.

Compassion doesn't always tell you what the most effective behavior is. That requires wisdom, a related skill. But compassion does ensure that you are acting in accordance with your deepest values; your profound love for the world, and not your self-deception. That seems like a good place to start.
