# Quantum misconceptions

There is much confusion around what (if anything) consciousness has to do with quantum mechanics. New Age literature claims that physics has identified a clear connection, whereas most physicists are confident that there is none.

It is difficult for a layperson to understand the nuances of the issue well enough to form an educated opinion without working through the math themselves. The purpose of this piece is to explain it clearly and simply.


## The facts

Here are two things that we know:

1. There is no known mechanism by which a "quantum experiment" (such as the infamous Schrodinger's Cat thought-experiment) could result in a single outcome.

2. You only ever _experience_ a single outcome (the cat is _ether_ dead or alive).

All known laws of physics are "unitary." This means (roughly) that whenever two possible things can happen (e.g., the radioactive sample decays or not), they will never "merge" back into being one thing.

> _In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions never disappear._ —[Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m4s), father of string theory

This is generally well accepted. There are physicists (like [Roger Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_interpretation)) working on non-unitary theories in which "collapse" is a real thing, but these are considered relatively fringe.

Another way to say this is that our conscious experience is the only place where we have evidence that only one thing happens.

This is, understandably, confusing. Here are some common misconceptions about it.

### Misconception 1: Consciousness must be where the "collapse" happens, and the two-slit experiment proves it!

> *The electron **decided** to act differently, as though it was **aware** that it was being watched!!*  —New Age movie [What The Bleep Do We Know?!](https://youtu.be/5WV1SMoVYDM?t=266)

This is profoundly misleading. The truth is that this result can be explained entirely in physical terms. The detector _entangles_ with the particle, reducing the possible set of outcomes to two, and preventing them from interfering with each other. There is no debate about this.

But this is not "collapse of the wavefunction." It is just a _change_ in the wavefunction, from being spread out (in a way that interferes with itself) to being localized to two positions. The key point is that there are **still two possibilities** — and no physical process can ever make them one (as far as we know). And yet we only ever _see_ one...

### Misconception 2: Decoherence solves it!

Decoherence is a phenomenon discovered in recent decades that explains why the two or more branches of a wavefunction never interfere in macroscopic experiments. A brief explanation for this is that in any realistic environment, photons and air molecules will almost instantly entangle with your system (in basically the same way that the detector does in the two-slit experiment), and the math predicts that there will be no more interference.

This leads many people (including some physicists!) to conclude that it solves the measurement problem. 

> *If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence will almost instantly **force it into one state or the other.*** — A physics Ph.D.(!) writing for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/)

But this is badly confused. Decoherence does not even attempt to explain why there is only one outcome; it only explains why the two outcomes can no longer interfere, allowing us to _pretend_ that our system has become classical. And since classical experiments have only one outcome _muble muble_ so do we.

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

[Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/373905/):

> But the collapse itself is not explained [by decoherence], there is still the sum [*N.B.: superposition*] in the above formula, still an "and" ...

This is the worst kind of red herring, because it masquerades as an explanation.

### Misconception 3: Many Worlds solves it!

The Many Worlds Interpretation "solves" the issue insofar as it says that there _is_ no issue. You see, the claim that "you only observe one result" is false. There are actually two _copies_ of "you," each in a different world, each seeing one result. You're wrong about what "you" are.

This is all well and good, but when precisely do you split in two? 

The atom was originally in a superposition of "decayed" and "not-decayed." Before interacting with the Geiger counter, nobody would say there are two worlds or two copies of you. There's just one world with a superposed atom in it. As the atom interacts (or not) with the macroscopic counter, decoherence "kicks in," making the superposition so complicated that no conceivable technology could detect it.

The two branches evolve effectively independently — _as if_ they belong to separate "worlds." But standard QM (of which MWI is just an interpretation) is unequivocal about this: anything that still outside the system (such as yourself) is still free to treat it as a superposition _because it really is one._ There aren't two "copies" of you, as much as MWI proponents want to say that there are.

Why do they want to say this? Because otherwise, we're forced to say that it only happens when you, personally, interact with the system. This would seem to imply roughly that "things only happen [in your private reality] when you personally interact with them," which is somehow even worse than the "things only become real when _we_ (humans) look at them" idea that they're trying to defeat.

In other words, it seems to be just another way to avoid psychological discomfort.

## A caveat

It is possible to accept that "you are the point at which things happen in your world" and not consider this strange. It is only "your" world, after all. On the other hand, it is also the place you normally just call "the" world — and it includes everyone you've ever known or will know. And it isn't just that you "find out" that things happen; it is in some sense when they "actually happen." (Though confusingly, once the Cat attains this definite fate, it will also turn out to have "always had" this fate ever since interacting with the apparatus.)

We also haven't made precise when the system can be said to have interacted with you. Even defining "you" is hard. In all likelihood, it happens long before you become "conscious" of it in the usual sense. But there's also no way of _knowing_ this — and so we seem to be back at square one.

It is a genuinely perplexing problem, and if you dig deeply enough into the assumptions that make anyone say otherwise, you will always find some place where this perplexity has been swept under the rug.

## Conclusion

It does seem to be true that consciousness in general has nothing to do with QM as far as we know. On the other hand, _you, personally_ seem to have everything to do with it, in some hard-to-define sense.

Though this may not be a majority opinion among physicists, it seems to be the inevitable conclusion if you refuse to cut corners anywhere. Lest you fear that this is a unique and bizarre personal opinion of mine, let me leave you with this:

> *I think consciousness will remain a mystery. I tend to think that the workings of the conscious brain will be elucidated to a large extent. Biologists and perhaps physicists will understand much better how the brain works. But why something that we call consciousness goes with those workings, I think will remain mysterious. Perhaps I'm mistaken. I have a much easier time imagining how we'd understand the Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness.*

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
> ...
> 
>  *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics, and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions; new aspects.*
