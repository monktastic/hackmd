> Reality suddenly popped into being, fully formed, five seconds ago -- with only the _appearance_ of a real past (including our false memories).

Intuitively, this _seems_ exceedingly unlikely to be true, but how can we justify this intuition?

Any evidence (such as pictures) or principles (such as Occam's Razor) that we may try to use can only come from the _past_—which we can't assume is real, on pain of circularity. There is therefore no rational basis on which to call the hypothesis either "likely" or "unlikely."

Indeed, it may not even be _meaningful_—
