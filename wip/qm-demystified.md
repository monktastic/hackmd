# QM and consciousness (for people who don't like math)

The founders of QM found its implications _unfathomably_ strange. In recent years, there has been a growing belief that they simply misunderstood, and that recent findings have resolved the central weirdness.

I think this is a profound misconception. Modern interpretations have not resolved the weirdness, but have only obscured it behind technical details. I hope to un-obscure some of those details so that you can appreciate the weirdness yourself, even if you're not mathematically inclined.

## Quick summary

A particle can be in a _superposition_ of many states at once. It may interact with other particles such that they _join_ the superposition. This superposition continues to grow, and so it is natural to ask at what point it "collapses" to become just one definite outcome or another.

As far as anyone knows, it never does. Instead, it eventually interacts with _you,_ and you join the superposition. This is the first time you can meaningfully say that there is one definite result (even if you're not consciously aware of what it is, or even that there is one). Another way of looking at it is that there are now two (or more) "copies" of you, each claiming that there is only one result.

So _you_ are the point at which quantum events attain definite outcomes in "your" world — which is just the place you call "the" world. And it is hard to find a precise definition of "you" here, though if you try, you will find yourself converging on "your consciousness."

There is nothing to suggest that you can _do_ anything with this oddity, such as choose which outcome you will see (or "world you will enter"). On the other hand, nothing exactly _prevents_ you either, but only because the question of which world you will see is in a sense meaningless in the first place (because from a larger perspective you see _both_)...

## Superposition and interference

Objects in the classical world obey classical probabilities. If we have an object that might be in state A or in state B (but we don't know which), the probability that it will next be in state C is given by the weighted average of the two individual transition probabilities (from A to C / B to C). In the quantum world, this doesn't work. In the two-slit experiment, a particle that went through either individual slit might _never_ arrive at some spot X, but a particle in a **superposition** of the two possibilities might indeed end up at that position (which is impossible by taking any weighted average of two 0% probabilities). This is how we know that a particle in a superposition is not in a classically indeterminate state — and crucially, to _prove_ this, we always need some kind of **interference experiment.**

## Entanglement and measurement

Suppose we have a particle in a superposition of _spin-up_ and _spin-down_ (along some axis). It might interact with a second particle in a natural way: "if" the first particle is spin-up, the second one becomes spin-up, too; and likewise for spin-down. "If" is in quotes because our particle isn't actually in a determinate state (and so the "if" condition doesn't really hold). And yet the logic applies in the expected way: after the interaction, the pair of particles will be in a superposition of _both spin-up_ and _both spin-down_. The crucial point is that this is indeed a superposition, and thus there is in theory some interference experiment we can do to _prove_ it.

Now, in one sense, we "measured" the first particle: its state is encoded perfectly by the second one, which we can thus think of as a (microscopic) "measuring device." On the other hand, the pair of particles is still in an indeterminate state — so if we want "measured" to mean that the particle is now in a definite state, well, then we're still not there. And yet, we know from experience that objects do ultimately end up in definite states. So how (and when) does this happen, exactly?

Say these two particles interact with a third particle, then a fourth, and so on. If each of these interactions produces yet another (larger) entanglement — that is, a superposition of increasingly many particles — then the first particle will _never_ be in a definite state. So there must be _some_ kind of interaction that doesn't result in a superposition, right? The problem is, there's not (as best we can tell). This principle is called _unitarity,_ and it's central to physics.

> _In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions never disappear._ —[Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m4s), father of string theory

## Many worlds?

Like we said, in our everyday experience, things _are_ in definite states: Schrödinger's cat is _either_ dead or alive. But if the cat's state could not have been made definite by any physical interactions "out there," the only conclusion is that it attained its definite state upon interaction with _us_. The original formulation of the Many Worlds Hypothesis (originally Everett's Relative State Interpretation) allowed for this quite naturally: when the ever-growing superposition (of radioactive atom + detector + poison + Cat + ...) reaches _us_, we join the superposition. One "copy" of us sees one outcome, and the other sees the other.

This is a fine interpretation, but it seemingly leaves the door open to woo: it would allow us to say that the Cat's state (for example) is only determined upon interaction with us, personally. In other words, that the world does not exist in a definite state until we ourselves perceive it. This is true whether we take the branching universes literally or not. Either way, so long as no physical interaction can "collapse" the state, the _apparent_ collapse happens only upon interaction with us. But then along came decoherence...

## Decoherence

Here's a curious fact whose implications it took us a long time to appreciate: if we have two particles in a (joint) superposition, and we want to _prove_ that they're still in superposition (i.e., they're not in definite states), then the interference experiment we do must involve **both** particles. If we interact with just one and ignore the other, we will **not** see interference. The one we measured will appear to behave classically — that is, we can predict its behavior using classical averages. This is a well-established fact. Nonetheless, our inability to _prove_ that it was in a superposition does not mean that it wasn't in one. In other words, the fact that it _appeared_ to be in a well-defined (if unknown) classical state does **not** mean that it actually was in one. It just means that we failed to do the proper experiment.

The same principle extends to larger superpositions: if we have a superposition of a trillion particles, our interference experiment must carefully involve **all** of them. If we fail to account for even one, then we're busted. As you can imagine, this is problematic. Quantum measurements are really hard to do even on a small number of particles. In particular, if our test particle interacts with ambient photons, air molecules, etc., then it is **completely hopeless** to run the appropriate interference experiment. This is called **decoherence.** It means that it is in practice impossible to demonstrate superpositions in any real-world setting — the key words being _in practice._

This leads some physicists to use imprecise language:

> *If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence will almost instantly **force it into one state or the other**.* —A physics Ph.D. writing for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/)

But this isn't quite true. It isn't "forced" into anything — it just _appears_ that way. Crucially, in cases where we _can_ conduct interference experiments on macroscopic (or at least mesoscopic) objects, we always discover that superpositions never _actually_ break down. Similarly:

>  _Interference demands a precise alignment of the quantum states, and once we lose information into the environment that becomes **impossible**. That’s decoherence. ... the difference between the two branches has diffused into the environment and is lost there **forever**._ —Caltech physicist [Sean Carroll](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/)

Words like "impossible" and "forever" are deeply misleading. Why does this matter? Because it's used to sweep the strangeness under the rug: if the Cat more-or-less attained a definite fate long before information from it reached us, then all this weirdness about observers just goes away. The problem is, it's not true. Yes, it's infinitely more convenient to _model_ things this way, but the theory (and experiments insofar as we can do them) are crystal clear: the Cat (+ environment) is **not** in a definite state prior to interacting with us. To be clear, the environment may very quickly leak information to us (and thus result in a definite state) long before we are consciously aware of the Cat's fate, but the crucial point is that it still involves _us._ That problem doesn't go away.

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

You've probably heard that a particle can be in something called a **superposition**. This means that it is not actually in one state or the other, but in _both_, in some sense. This is the central weirdness of QM, and so it's worth taking some time to understand it. What does it mean for an object to be in two states at once, and how could we even know that it was? Can this apply to macroscopic objects, and if so, what are the implications? Does it have anything to do with consciousness?

Physics is concerned with observable properties of objects, or **observables** for short. These are anything we can measure. Some particles have an observable called "spin." Without worrying too much about what it _is_, just know that we can pick an axis in space (x, y, or z) and measure the particle's spin along that axis. Doing so always yields one of two results, which are named "spin-up" and "spin-down" (regardless of the axis chosen, perhaps confusingly).

When we say that a particle is in a _superposition_ of spin-up and spin-down (along the x-axis, say), we mean a few things. First, if we were to measure it, we would get each result with some probability that depends on the details of the superposition (50-50 if it is balanced). The second thing is harder to explain. It says that knowing how a spin-up particle behaves and how a spin-down particle behaves is not enough information to tell you how a superposition behaves.

To use the more familiar example of the two-slit experiment, we cannot look at how a particle behaves going through each slit individually and then combine the two to determine what pattern a superposition will produce. We have to do a completely _different_ calculation to predict the correct interference pattern.

What this tells us is that a superposition means more than just "it's in one state or the other, but we don't know which" (which we call _classical uncertainty_). Otherwise, combining the two individual cases would _have_ to work. The fact that it doesn't means that we're dealing with a new kind of logic. We can't even say that "it's in both states at once." It means some kind of new and bizarre thing that we shouldn't try to describe in classical terms.

Now here's the crucial point: this allows us to determine whether a given object is in a superposition or merely a classically uncertain state — and we do that with something called an **interference experiment**. Don't worry how it works: just know that an object is in superposition if (and only if) there exists some interference experiment to prove it. We may not have the technology (now or ever) to _do_ that experiment, but it must exist in theory. If so, we can say that our particle is still "quantum." Otherwise, it has become classical.

We know that particles have quantum behavior and that we never see everyday objects behave that way. The key question is _why?_ Is there some size beyond which objects cannot be in superpositions? Most QM textbooks gloss over this question. From an experimental perspective, all (most) physicists care about is that when we "measure" a particle, the superposition appears to collapse. But what _precisely_ constitutes a "measurement"? This is called the **measurement problem**, and most physicists don't need to care about it.

> *I suspect that a substantial majority of physicists who use quantum mechanics in their everyday work are uninterested in or downright hostile to attempts to understand the quantum measurement problem.*
>
> — Caltech physicist Sean Carroll

To understand it better, let's see what happens when our superposition interacts with other particles.

---

## Entanglement

So, we have this particle in a superposition of spin-up and spin-down. Let's say it interacts with a second particle according to a simple kind of logic: if our particle is spin-up, it will cause the second one to become spin-up (and similarly for spin-down). What will happen when our superposed particle interacts with this second one?

The short answer is that the second particle will _join_ the first one to create a _joint superposition_. The two are now in a combination of "both particles are spin-up" and "both particles are spin-down" — with the caveat that the "and" between those phrases is our quantum kind of "and." We call this **entanglement**.

> **Aside**: one implication is that if you were to measure the spin of either particle, you would automatically know the spin of the other one without having to measure it. So each particle encodes information about the other. Colloquially, we might say that the second particle "measured" the first one by interacting with it. But this doesn't mean we have a complete answer to the measurement problem.

It is important to understand is that because the pair is still quantum, we cannot say that either result (up/up or down/down) has "actually happened" yet. We cannot argue that "maybe it has, but we just don't know it yet" — because there is an interference experiment that gives lie to that claim.

But here's the really crucial bit: that interference experiment can only be done if we have extremely precise control over **both** particles. They must not have interacted with anything else, and we must be able to measure each one precisely. This is only possible in an extremely advanced laboratory.

What happens if you have access to only _one_ of the particles? It turns out that any experiment you do on that one particle alone will yield classical results! In other words, it looks like it has "become classical" — but that's only because we don't have the ability to see the larger picture.

And what happens if the two _did_ interact with something else — say, a third particle? Then the superposition _spreads_ to this third particle. Now, the interference experiment must include all three. If you only look at two, they will appear classical.

The key takeaway is this: the more particles a superposition involves, the harder it becomes to do an experiment that _proves_ that it's still in a superposition. 
That leads us into **decoherence**. But before we get there, a quick aside.

---

## Aside: the two-slit experiment

We are now prepared to understand the two-slit experiment a little better. 

When our electron interacts with the detector at the slits, they become entangled. Therefore, the electron _by itself_ can no longer show interference — but the electron + detector system is. To prove this, you would need to perform an interference experiment that included both. But in the usual experiment, we just measure the electron by itself at the screen. As predicted by QM, it doesn't show interference alone. 

This doesn't mean that the electron's position has actually "collapsed"; just that it _appears_ to have, because we are ignoring some context (the detector).

This has nothing to do with consciousness, despite breathless claims to the contrary[^PBS]:

> *The electron **decided** to act differently, as though it was **aware** that it was being watched!!*
>
> — New Age movie [What The Bleep](https://youtu.be/5WV1SMoVYDM?t=266)

[^PBS]: It's not just New Age sources getting it wrong. This [PBS Spacetime episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs) wrongly explains that it's due to the detector adding a random phase to one or both paths. If that were true, we would expect to see a smeared-out blur instead of the two bright classical-looking bands that we actually see. If you enjoy math, you can see the details of what actually happens [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/205121).

Just because we discover a new interesting behavior doesn't mean we have to ascribe _consciousness_ to it. When we discovered general relativity, we didn't say that spacetime "decided" to warp itself in the presence of massive objects because it was "aware" of them. Such claims (understandably) annoy physicists.

---

## Decoherence

In any realistic setting, the particles won't just interact with a third particle; they will interact with untold _trillions_ more. This means that the ability to demonstrate superposition at the macroscopic scale is nigh impossible. This fact is called **decoherence**, and it's a relatively recent development in QM. It's gotten a lot of attention in the popular press, because it _seems_ to resolve the central weirdness.

> *If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence will almost instantly **force it into one state or the other**.* —A physics Ph.D. writing for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/)

Hmm. As we just saw, decoherence doesn't actually "force" the superposition into one state or another. It just makes it _behave_ like it has, for all practical purposes.

Why does that distinction matter? Because if the superposition actually "collapses" long before it reaches you, then _you_ have nothing whatsoever to do with QM. But QM doesn't actually predict this. In fact, no physicist even _believes_ that it does. But that doesn't stop them from writing _as though_ it does.

>  _Interference demands a precise alignment of the quantum states, and once we lose information into the environment that becomes **impossible**. That’s decoherence. ... the difference between the two branches has diffused into the environment and is lost there **forever**._ —Caltech physicist [Sean Carroll](http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/)

Again, it's not literally _impossible_ or _forever_. Here's [Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m4s), father of string theory:

> _In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions **never** disappear._

I think it is a shame that popular science articles — written even by famous physicists — obscure this subtle issue.

From the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

At some point, information from a quantum experiment (such as Schrodinger's Cat) will reach _you_. Depending on where you're standing in relationship to the cat-box, that can happen much quicker than you realize. _Some_ microscopic amount of information will reach you (i.e., entangle with you), one way or another, even without you being consciously aware of it. 

From a "God's-eye" perspective, all that has happened is that you have _joined_ the superposition. But from _your_ perspective, there is no longer a superposition. For you, there is now one definite outcome or the other. Even if you don't know what it is (or that there even is one), it is impossible _even in principle_ for you to do an interference experiment: you would have to be standing _outside_ the superposition, and you are now _inside_ it.

This is the first time you can say, in principle, that there is a single definite result. In other words, the cat only attains a definite fate when information about it reaches you, personally. Is this weird? It depends on how we look at it. 

The Many Worlds Interpretation would say that there are two "worlds," and in each there is a copy of you seeing one result. Therefore, they can say the cat only attains a definite fate in "your world" when you see it. But this doesn't actually make it any less weird for you, because "your world" is just the place you normally call "the" world. This is why the decoherence story is pushed so hard: if we can say that the worlds split way back "when decoherence happened"  — as most modern formulations of MWI do — then _you_ have no role to play. But this is misleading, as we saw.

> _That’s decoherence. [...] It is as if they have become distinct worlds — because they have._ —Sean Carroll

But what does "you" mean, exactly? Surely you can treat your big toe like any other external physical system, and so it isn't "you." As you try to close in on "you," you enter an investigation that is common in spirituality. "I" is just another word for "consciousness." And yet it can't mean our everyday sense of that word because, as we just saw, you can become entangled even without knowing it.

It is in this sense that consciousness remains inextricably linked to the mysteries of QM, though we don't understand what exactly this connection is.

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
> ...
>  *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics, and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions; new aspects.*

Okay, but so what? What can you _do_ with this?

Much of the spiritual interest in QM has to do with the "Law of Attraction": that your thoughts influence reality. Does the above story lend any support to that? Well, no — but there is one aspect that leaves the door open for _something_ interesting.

As far as we know, it is impossible to predict the outcome of any quantum event. There are numerous (very clever) experiments that strongly suggest that this is not due to mere lack of knowledge, but is somehow fundamental. Specifically, there are no *physical facts* that would allow for prediction. We might describe this as a profound _openness_ or un-constrainedness of reality.

This openness is only interesting if quantum events actually affect the world in large and interesting ways. For example, imagine that the Cat is beloved to many people, and its fate changes their behavior, even in a small way. Over time, this will compound. The fate of the world thus diverges on a meaningful scale. This was only possible because the Geiger counter amplified the tiny superposition into something macroscopic, which then had a domino effect. But this setup is extremely contrived. Does any such thing exist in the natural world?

We've recently discovered that humans are able to perceive _single photons_ (or thereabouts). That means that our _brains_ are in fact natural quantum amplification devices! We are far from understanding the full extent or implications of this, but it does leave the door open for something interesting. It means that the possible "worlds" may be diverging in much larger ways than we might otherwise have expected.

Still, there is no way to _control_ which outcome you will see, because _nothing_ controls it. Quantum events don't have "causes" as such. This is good and bad news for the New Age hypothesis. On one hand, it provides no mechanism by which you could control the outcome. On the other hand, such control could not be ruled out in the usual way that "supernatural" things are, by claiming that it violates some specific physical law.

If someone _did_ have such an ability, it would have to be non-physical (and thus physics would have nothing to say about it). If they were too brazen about using it, they might produce statistical anomalies (for example, deviating too far from 50% heads amongst quantum coin flips) that might raise eyebrows. But it would never leave a trace of any specific physical law violation.

What would be the best way to use such powers without "raising eyebrows"? It would be to influence quantum events outside of laboratories, so that nobody would be keeping track of whether the stats looked unusual. Coupled with the natural amplification abilities of brains everywhere, perhaps this could be used to have large-scale influences without anyone noticing that something strange was happening.

We are now _well_ into the realm of science fiction, but I admit it can be fun to think about.

---

If decoherence can be made to sound like a clear-cut event that completes long before the superposition reaches you, and this is what causes worlds to "actually" split, then _you_ are off the hook: quantum mechanics has _nothing_ to do with you. That would be nice, but it isn't true.

[^decoherence]:
    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence) on decoherence:
    > _A total superposition of the global or universal wavefunction still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an interpretational issue._

    [Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/373905/):

    > But the collapse itself is not explained [by decoherence], there is still the sum [*N.B.: superposition*] in the above formula, still an "and" ...

Instead, what happens is that _you_ eventually become entangled with it. At this point, it is not even _theoretically_ possible (for you) to do an interference experiment, because you would have to stand outside yourself to include "both versions of" you. Therefore, at this point _you_ can finally say that there is a single definite result (even if you don't know what it is).

On one hand, this shouldn't be surprising: it is just saying that there is a result _for you_ when the system entangles with _you_. That's a tautology, given the rules as we know them. Indeed, from the perspective of _any_ of the particles in the chain, the "collapse" happens precisely when _it_ becomes entangled. And from a "God's-eye" view, you have merely joined the superposition, just like the other particles. In this sense, you are in fact not special. 

On the other hand, you cannot actually take a "God's-eye" perspective, or _any_ perspective other than your own — and from _that_ perspective, you are indeed "special." Not in a merely philosophical sense, but in a physically meaningful (if presently impossible to prove) one. **You** are the point at which quantum events suddenly obtain definite results in "your world" — i.e., the place you know as "the" world. This is not a mystical interpretation, but the most straightforward reading of the theory.

And what does "you" mean here? After all, you can treat your big toe as just another external physical device. As you work your way back, you will find yourself closing in on _your consciousness_[^consciousness].

This is the same punchline that the founders discovered long ago, and that we have been desperately — but unsuccessfully — trying to avoid ever since.

As Eugene Wigner said all the way back in 1963:

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
of an observation enters the consciousness of the observer — or, to be even more painfully precise, my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people being only subjects of my observations.*  ...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

To be clear, it is _not_ solipsism, but it shares some of its unsettling features. Of _course_ we are compelled to find a way out.

Lest you think I am alone in making this connection:

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum mechanics and its applications to the universe.*

But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics, and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions; new aspects.*

[^consciousness]: To be clear, "consciousness" cannot refer to our usual, commonsense definition. For example, suppose different colored lights turn on depending on whether the Cat lives or dies. Furthermore, suppose you don't know which light is which — in fact, you don't even realize that the lights signify anything at all. Maybe you only catch a glimpse from the corner of your eye. By any reasonable account, you are _profoundly_ entangled with the system, even though you are not "conscious" of it in the usual sense.

## Quantum biology

Another area that we ought to touch on is _quantum biology._ There are many fascinating findings in this field, but the one I find most exciting is this: human beings are able to detect _single photons_ (above chance) at the conscious level.

Why is this interesting?

Consider the Schrodinger's Cat apparatus. It starts with a single molecule, and the quantum uncertainty gets magnified up to the macroscopic level. Such "amplification" is ridiculously contrived, and was not believed to happen commonly in nature: most quantum events leave no visible traces in the world. Now we are finding that _human brains_ can act as such amplifiers.

Therefore, between the time you go to sleep and when you wake up, billions of people might be making macroscopically-relevant decisions. This means that the space of possible worlds you could wake up to might be tremendous, indeed.

---

Okay, now that we've covered the well-established stuff, let's play around a bit with crazy ideas.

---

## The "Law of Attraction?"

One area that's become popular in the New Age movement is connecting QM to the so-called "Law of Attraction." But what (if anything) does the science have to say?

So far we have said that quantum events attain definite results when they reach _you._ But as far as we know, _which_ result is obtained is completely random. Two things are meant by "random" here:

1. There are no physical facts that would allow us to _predict_ the outcome (let alone influence it), and
2. _Sequences_ of outcomes (for the same experiment) seem to be statistically random.

Another way of looking at (1) is that nothing can be said to have _caused_ one outcome instead of another. Therefore, questions like "_why_ did I see this particular result" not only have no (physical) _answer_; they don't even have physical _meaning._ Using the language of Many Worlds, a perfectly valid answer would be "actually, (a copy of) you saw each result!" You might press further: "okay, but why did _this copy_ see _this result_?" and the answer would be "well, that's what it _means_ to be 'this copy'!" 

Although those answers used the language of Many Worlds, the same essential problem plagues _all_ (no-collapse) interpretations.

Therefore, if you claim to be _influencing_ which branches you follow, well, there's nothing that physics could really say about this. Nothing could specifically _prevent_ it, because the claim doesn't have physical meaning. By the same token, physics cannot _support_ your claim, either.

In the end, any such "ability" would only appear as a statistical anomaly, with no possibility of _explanation_ in the usual sense.
