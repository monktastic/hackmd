What is the true nature of reality? What is the cause of this astonishing experience you call "life"? The answer seems obvious: there is a fundamentally lifeless physical reality "out there," and through a series of random interactions, it produces the remarkable phenomenon we call "consciousness."

Here's the thing though: this view is impossible to prove. It may seem like we can at least call it "likely," but this, too is an illusion. It relies on assumptions — for example, that evidence itself is reliable, and not some kind of elaborate hoax — that must ultimately be taken on faith.

The most that can be said is that this view is _comfortable._ There is an aspect of your mind that continually needs reassurance, and it is this aspect that generates the illusion that your worldview is true, or at least "likely."

One description of spiritual awakening is that it is when you first discover that this aspect of mind doesn't actually know what it's talking about. Understanding this fact is one thing, but directly experiencing it is quite another.

Following such an "awakening," people often tend to make radically different assertions about the nature of reality. But on what basis can they do this? Isn't it "much more likely" that their brain is simply tricking them into believing something weird? Hopefully you can see the problem here: the basis on which you call this "more likely" is precisely what evaporates in such an experience. 

When such a person claims that consciousness is "more real" than physical reality, they are now using a different definition of "real" than they were before — a definition that can't possibly _mean_ anything to someone who hasn't penetrated this illusion yet.
