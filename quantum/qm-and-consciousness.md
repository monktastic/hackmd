# QM and consciousness (for people who don't like math)

The founders of QM found its implications _unfathomably_ strange. There is a growing modern belief that they simply misunderstood, and that modern findings have resolved the central weirdness.

This is a misconception. Modern interpretations have not resolved the weirdness, but have only obscured it behind technical details. I hope to un-obscure some of those details so that you can stare that weirdness in the face yourself.

A single particle can be in a **superposition**. This means that it is not actually in one state or the other, and crucially, this can be _proven_ by something called an **interference experiment.** As other particles interact with the superposition, they simply _join_ it (i.e., become **entangled** with it). In this way, the superposition just keeps growing and growing forever[^collapse].

[^collapse]: Interpretations of QM can be broadly divided into _collapse_ and _no-collapse_. The former state that superpositions undergo a real physical collapse. Technically, their distinct predictions make them distinct _theories_, and not _interpretations_ of QM. The vast majority of physicists are in the no-collapse camp. This piece takes the no-collapse perspective, and is agnostic about interpretation.

Doing an interference experiment requires careful control over **all** particles in the superposition. If you lose track of any of them, or conduct an experiment on only a _subset_, you will no longer see interference. This has a few immediate consequences:

1. In the double-slit experiment, once the electron entangles with the detector at the slits (which is what makes it a "detector" in the first place), the electron _by itself_ can no longer show interference. This is a well-studied effect of entanglement. There is nothing spooky going on here, and it has nothing to do with consciousness, despite claims to the contrary:

> *The electron **decided** to act differently, as though it was **aware** that it was being watched!!*
>
> -- New Age movie [What The Bleep](https://youtu.be/5WV1SMoVYDM?t=266)

(**Update**: it is also not because of the detector adding a random phase to one or both paths, as this [PBS Spacetime episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlOwJWJWPUs) wrongly explains. If that were true, we would expect to see a smeared-out blur instead of the two bright classical-looking bands that we actually see. If you enjoy math, you can see the details worked out [here](https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/205121).)

Sometimes people think of such a measurement as "collapse of the wavefunction," but this is not quite correct. The electron + detector system is still in a _joint_ superposition (of _left_ and _right_ outcomes), which then grows to include the screen, etc.

2. When information is dissipated into the environment (such as air molecules and photons), performing an interference experiment quickly becomes hopeless. Any experiment you try to run will show only classical results.

This apparent loss of superposition is called **decoherence**, and it happens almost instantaneously in any real-world setting. The superposition still technically exists, but the branches will now evolve independently of each other. Unfortunately, it is often wrongly described as the superposition _collapsing_
[^decoherence]:

> *If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence will almost instantly **force it into one state or the other**.* — A physics Ph.D. writing for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/)

It is not "forced" into anything. The dead cat and live cat branches cannot _interfere,_ but this is not at all the same thing as saying that they don't _exist_. Everything we know tells us that they do. It may be effectively impossible to prove this, but the word "effectively" is often quietly dropped:

>  Interference demands a precise alignment of the quantum states, and once we lose information into the environment that becomes **impossible**. That’s decoherence. ... the difference between the two branches has diffused into the environment and is lost there **forever**.

Lest you think I am nitpicking, here's [Leonard Susskind](https://youtu.be/iNgIl-qIklU?t=3m4s), father of string theory:

> In fact, I think of it as more basic than any of the other principles of physics. The most basic principle of physics is that distinctions never disappear.

So why do Carroll et al. use words like "impossible" and "forever" when they know perfectly well that they are not literally true? A hint can be found in Carroll's next claim:

>  It is as if they have become distinct worlds — because they have.

If decoherence can be made to sound like a clear-cut event that completes long before the superposition reaches you, and this is what causes worlds to "actually" split, then _you_ are off the hook: quantum mechanics has _nothing_ to do with you. That would be nice, but it isn't true.

[^decoherence]:

    [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence):
    > A total superposition of the global or universal wavefunction still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an interpretational issue.

    The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

    > Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

    [Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/373905/):

    > But the collapse itself is not explained [by decoherence], there is still the sum [*N.B.: superposition*] in the above formula, still an "and" ...

Instead, what happens is that _you_ eventually become entangled with it. At this point, it is not even _theoretically_ possible (for you) to do an interference experiment, because you would have to stand outside yourself to include "both versions of" you. Therefore, at this point _you_ can finally say that there is a single definite result (even if you don't know what it is).

On one hand, this shouldn't be surprising: it is just saying that there is a result _for you_ when the system entangles with _you_. That's a tautology, given the rules as we know them. Indeed, from the perspective of _any_ of the particles in the chain, the "collapse" happens precisely when _it_ becomes entangled. And from a "God's-eye" view, you have merely joined the superposition, just like the other particles. In this sense, you are in fact not special. 

On the other hand, you cannot actually take a "God's-eye" perspective, or _any_ perspective other than your own — and from _that_ perspective, you are indeed "special." Not in a merely philosophical sense, but in a physically meaningful (if presently impossible to prove) one. **You** are the point at which quantum events suddenly obtain definite results in "your world" — i.e., the place you know as "the" world. This is not a mystical interpretation, but the most straightforward reading of the theory.

And what does "you" mean here? After all, you can treat your big toe as just another external physical device. As you work your way back, you will find yourself closing in on _your consciousness_[^consciousness].

This is the same punchline that the founders discovered long ago, and that we have been desperately — but unsuccessfully — trying to avoid ever since.

As Eugene Wigner said all the way back in 1963:

> *This [reduction of the quantum state] takes place whenever the result
of an observation enters the consciousness of the observer — or, to be even more painfully precise, my own consciousness, since I am the only observer, all other people being only subjects of my observations.*  ...
>
> *However, to deny the existence of the consciousness of a friend to this
extent is surely an unnatural attitude, approaching solipsism, and few
people, in their hearts, will go along with it.*

To be clear, it is _not_ solipsism, but it shares some of its unsettling features. Of _course_ we are compelled to find a way out.

Lest you think I am alone in making this connection:

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
> ...
>  *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics, and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions; new aspects.*

[^consciousness]: To be clear, "consciousness" cannot refer to our usual, commonsense definition. For example, suppose different colored lights turn on depending on whether the Cat lives or dies. Furthermore, suppose you don't know which light is which — in fact, you don't even realize that the lights signify anything at all. Maybe you only catch a glimpse from the corner of your eye. By any reasonable account, you are _profoundly_ entangled with the system, even though you are not "conscious" of it in the usual sense.

## Quantum biology

Another area that we ought to touch on is _quantum biology._ There are many fascinating findings in this field, but the one I find most exciting is this: human beings are able to detect _single photons_ (above chance) at the conscious level.

Why is this interesting?

Consider the Schrodinger's Cat apparatus. It starts with a single molecule, and the quantum uncertainty gets magnified up to the macroscopic level. Such "amplification" is ridiculously contrived, and was not believed to happen commonly in nature: most quantum events leave no visible traces in the world. Now we are finding that _human brains_ can act as such amplifiers.

Therefore, between the time you go to sleep and when you wake up, billions of people might be making macroscopically-relevant decisions. This means that the space of possible worlds you could wake up to might be tremendous, indeed.

Okay, now that we've covered the well-established stuff, let's play around a bit with crazy ideas.

## The "Law of Attraction?"

One area that's become popular in the New Age movement is connecting QM to the so-called "Law of Attraction." But what (if anything) does the science have to say?

So far we have said that quantum events attain definite results when they reach _you._ But as far as we know, _which_ result is obtained is completely random. This means that:

1. There are no physical facts that would allow us to _predict_ the outcome (let alone influence it), and
2. _Sequences_ of outcomes (for the same experiment) seem to be statistically random.

Another way of looking at (1) is that nothing can be said to have _caused_ one outcome instead of another. Therefore, questions like "_why_ did I see this particular result" not only have no (physical) _answer_; they don't even have physical _meaning._ Using the language of Many Worlds, a perfectly valid answer would be "actually, (a copy of) you saw each result!" You might press further: "okay, but why did _this copy_ see _this result_?" and the answer would be "well, that's what it _means_ to be 'this copy'!" 

Although those answers used the language of Many Worlds, the same essential problem plagues _all_ (no-collapse) interpretations.

Therefore, if you claim to be _influencing_ which branches you follow, well, there's nothing that physics could really say about this. Nothing could specifically _prevent_ it, because the claim doesn't have physical meaning. By the same token, physics cannot _support_ your claim, either.

In the end, any such "ability" would only appear as a statistical anomaly, with no possibility of _explanation_ in the usual sense.
