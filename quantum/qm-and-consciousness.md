# Quantum mechanics for people who don't like math


### Collapse or no collapse?

Superpositions usually begin small, with a single particle. When another particle interacts with it, the two become **entangled**. In other words, the superposition *grows* to include it.

As best we can tell, superpositions just keep on growing in this way. But of course, you and I never see superpositions; we only ever see single results. The question is, why? This is called the **measurement problem**.

There are roughly two camps of explanation:

1. **Collapse**. Perhaps at some point, superpositions simply *collapse* into single results. The problem is, there's (basically) no evidence for this. Moreover, such a process would break essentially all the core principles of physics.
2. **No collapse**. In these interpretations, superpositions keep growing forever. The obvious problem is that it still doesn't explain why we see just one result.

Only a small percentage of physicists still believe in collapse. Strictly speaking, collapse interpretations aren't really *interpretations* of QM, but distinct *theories,* since they make different predictions. So **when we talk about QM in this piece, we will assume no collapse**.

This gives rise to more questions.

### How can we say there is "no evidence" for collapse, given that we see only one result?

Well, to *prove* that a system is in superposition, we must do something called an **interference experiment**. And every time we've been able to conduct such an experiment, it has come back positive. We've even done so with systems of *billions* of particles, and see no evidence of an upper bound.

But aren't *humans* an upper bound? The problem is, it's essentially impossible to *do* interference experiments at the scale of humans, so we can't know whether such an experiment would come back negative.

More on this later.

### Isn't *every* physical interaction a "measurement?"

> *Most physicists think today that a measurement is an interaction with some apparatus. It has nothing to do with whether you or someone else looks at the result, or whether you tell someone about it.* --- Physicist [Sabine Hossenfelder](https://youtu.be/v1wqUCATYUA?t=218)

Unfortunately, this is a very confusing usage of the word "measurement." It is not an answer to the *measurement problem.*

Imagine a device meant to detect whether your particle went *left* or *right.* For it to do this, it must interact with the particle. In particular, it must be able to give some indication of whether the particle went left or right. But this is the very *definition* of entanglement. Therefore, *every* system that preferentially interacts with your superposition is "measuring" it in one sense of the word. But this isn't very interesting.

### Decoherence?

There's a popular idea making the rounds in recent years that goes like this:

> *If you simply stick a cat in a box and link its fate to the outcome of some quantum event, you’re not likely to put it in a superposition of alive and dead, because decoherence will almost instantly force it into one state or the other.* --- A physics Ph.D. writing for [Quanta Magazine](https://www.quantamagazine.org/real-life-schrodingers-cats-probe-the-boundary-of-the-quantum-world-20180625/)

This one is deeply frustrating, because it's frequently repeated even by physicists who know (or *should* know) better. Here's what they mean.

Remember how we said that to *prove* that a system is in superposition, you need to do an interference experiment? This requires precise control over *every single particle* in the superposition. Otherwise, you will get a result that is indistinguishable from classical physics.

In any real-world setting, such control becomes practically impossible almost instantly. But here's the crucial point: *practically* is not the same thing as *actually!* Just because you can safely *pretend* that the superposition "collapsed" does not mean that it *did.* This does **not** solve the measurement problem.

Don't take my word for it:

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

[Physics StackExchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/373905/):

> But the collapse itself is not explained [by decoherence], there is still the sum [*N.B.: superposition*] in the above formula, still an "and" ...

### Detectors are "aware"?

Recall that in the two-slit experiment, placing a detector at the slits destroys the interference pattern. Here's a bad explanation for what's happening:

> *The electron decided to act differently, as though it was **aware** that it was being watched!!*
>
> -- New Age movie [What The Bleep](https://youtu.be/5WV1SMoVYDM?t=266)

In the decoherence section, we explained that interference experiments require precise control over *all* particles in the superposition. If you experiment on any *subset* of them ---  i.e., if you leave out even a *single* particle --- it will appear to behave classically. The same thing is doing on here.

When the electron interacts with the detector, the superposition grows to include both of them. When you measure *only* the electron, it won't show interference. But it didn't "decide" anything, and it wasn't "aware" of anything. It's a purely physical result.

Moreover, the electron + detector + screen system is still in superposition --- assuming *you* haven't seen it. More on that later.

### Many worlds?

The Many-Worlds Interpretation is a popular no-collapse interpretation. Its proponents like it because they say that it is the *simplest* explanation --- in the sense of making the fewest extra assumptions.

Opponents, of course, say that the existence of an infinite number of parallel-but-invisible universes can hardly be called "simple."

Being an *interpretation,* it does not make different predictions than the others. Therefore, it's not clear what it would mean to be either true or false.

### Consciousness and QM

Although very few modern physicists draw a link between QM and consciousness, there's one conclusion that is hard to avoid.

As long as a superposition has not entangled with you, QM predicts that you are capable of doing an interference experiment to prove its existence --- even though decoherence makes this *practically* impossible.

Once you entangle with it, there is no interpretation of QM that would permit you to do such an experiment --- because it would have to now include *you.* At this point, you are effectively *forced* to say that there is a single result.

Therefore, from your perspective, all superpositions indeed resolve at *you.* But what does "you" mean, exactly? For example, you are free to treat *your big toe* as just another physical system outside yourself. As you trace your way back, you find yourself closing in on *your consciousness.* On the other hand, physics doesn't even yet have a good *definition* of consciousness.

Personally, I think that this makes most physicists deeply uncomfortable, and explains why some would rather pretend that decoherence solves everything, as well as why they are "downright hostile" to answering the measurement problem.

Also note that "consciousness" cannot refer to our usual, commonsense definition. For example, it's entirely possible that you *have* consciously gotten information, but don't *know* that you have. Suppose a live cat triggers one colored light, and a dead cat triggers another --- but you don't know which is which. Maybe you don't even know that the lights signify a result. In fact, maybe you only see the light from the corner of your eye.

Nonetheless, by all accounts you are profoundly entangled with the system, and therefore it has a definite result --- even though you would certainly not say that you are *conscious* that it has one, let alone what it is.

### The outcome of a quantum event is not determined by any other facts in physical reality.

For example, the fate of Schrodinger's Cat depends entirely on whether the particle decays, but whether it decays is not itself dictated by anything. It is not merely that we don't _know_ the cause; our best theories suggest that there can _be_ no physical explanation.

From the perspective of the Many Worlds Interpretation (MWI), the very question of why it behaved one way instead of the other is meaningless: it did both, in different worlds. You might ask "okay, but why does *this me* see *this result*?" The answer is that that's what it *means* to be "this you."

It certainly *feels* like there's still a meaningful question that deserves an answer, but if so, it's probably not one that physics can answer.
