No elaborate experiments necessarily required (although they could help nudge us in the right direction, no doubt about that). But if anything, that makes the embarrassment more acute. All we have to do is wrap our brains around the issue, and yet we’ve failed to do so.*

    > A total superposition of the global or universal wavefunction still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an interpretational issue.

The [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-decoherence/#SolMeaPro):

> Unfortunately, naive claims of the kind that decoherence gives a complete answer to the measurement problem are still somewhat part of the ‘folklore’ of decoherence, and deservedly attract the wrath of physicists (e.g. Pearle 1997) and philosophers (e.g. Bub 1997, Chap. 8) alike.

> *I think consciousness will remain a mystery. I tend to think that the workings of the conscious brain will be elucidated to a large extent. Biologists and perhaps physicists will understand much better how the brain works. But why something that we call consciousness goes with those workings, I think will remain mysterious. Perhaps I'm mistaken. I have a much easier time imagining how we'd understand the Big Bang than I have imagining how we can understand consciousness.*

> *I’m not going to attempt to define consciousness, in a way that’s connected with the fact that I don’t believe it will become part of physics. And that has to do, I think, with the mysteries that bother a lot of people about quantum mechanics and its applications to the universe.*
> ...
>  *Quantum mechanics kind of has an all-embracing property, that to completely make sense it has to be applied to everything in sight, including ultimately, the observer. But trying to apply quantum mechanics to ourselves makes us extremely uncomfortable. Especially because of our consciousness, which seems to clash with that idea. So we’re left with a disquiet concerning quantum mechanics, and its applications to the universe. And I do not believe that disquiet will go away. If anything, I suspect that it will acquire new dimensions; new aspects.*
