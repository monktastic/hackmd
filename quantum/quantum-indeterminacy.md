The 2022 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded for experiments demonstrating violations of the Bell inequalities. They showed that entanglement is real and indeed causes "spooky [correlations] at a distance." But as amazing as this is, there have been more recent developments which, while less well-known, are even more astonishing.

I'd like to share a little about them, highlighting an aspect that I think is under-appreciated.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle puts a limit on how well we can know the values of what are called _complementary observables_, like position and momentum. If you know exactly _where_ a particle is, then its momentum is completely uncertain. You can then _measure_ its momentum, but then its _position_ becomes uncertain.

This may not seem all that strange: being _uncertain_ about the value of some property sounds like a statement about our knowledge, and it's hardly a surprise that this might be limited. But QM suggests something far stranger: that the value simply _did not exist_ before measurement.

Reflect on how such a claim could ever be experimentally tested. What experiment could you possibly design to test the hypothesis that not only did you not _know_ the value of some property, but that no such value even existed to _be_ known? It should strike you as _logically impossible_ to test such a thing --- and indeed, before quantum mechanics, it _was._

Imagine you are God, designing a universe for sentient beings. As you invent the concepts of "past" and "future," what are some qualities that you'd like them to have?

The "past" should probably be something over and done with; fixed and static, and not liable to change. By contrast, "the future" should be _open_ in some sense: there should always be _possibilities._ This keeps the game exciting.

Moreover, say you would like the inhabitants to one day be able to _prove_ that the future is open. Therefore, you cannot simply give them classical ("billiard-ball") physics with some randomness sprinkled in: they would forever suspect that they're just missing something.

What modifications would you have to make in order to let them _prove_ it? It turns out that the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is one such modification --- and perhaps the simplest.

In QM, position and momentum cannot be thought of as independent properties (as they are in classical physics), but are instead like different aspects of the _same_ underlying property. One implication is that we find certain correlations between their measurements.

The _spin_ of a particle along the x, y, and z axes are related to each other in a similar way: they are expressions of a shared property (simply called _spin_). These are a bit easier to work with, since each can take on only a small handful of values 
(for example, -1/2 or 1/2 for an electron, and -1, 0, or 1 for a photon).

You can also pick _new_ x, y, and z axes, and QM predicts certain correlations with these, too. For example, if you get some result for spin along the x-axis, and then measure it along a new x-axis that is very close to the old one, you ought to get the _same_ result with high probability.

Now, if you assume that a photon _has_ definite spins along the x-, y-, and z-axes --- for all possible x, y, and z --- then it turns to be impossible to satisfy all of these correlations. In other words, the photon cannot be simply "looking up" its answers to your queries in a table and still give the experimental results predicted (and confirmed) by QM.

Kochen and Specker proved this in 1967, but with a caveat: the photon _can_ be looking up its results, if the lookup table doesn't depend only on the direction you choose, but also which two other perpendicular directions you choose to measure beforehand. If you are now measuring in the x-axis, the answer will depend on whether you previously measured y and z, or some other y' and z'.

This is called _contextuality._ It puts a constraint on such "hidden variable" theories, but it's not quite as strong as we'd like. Particles cannot have pre-existing properties that are independent of context, but they can still have a certain kind of pre-existence. What's fascinating about this proof is that it only requires elementary counting arguments, and does not require deep knowledge of QM: if you try to color the points on the surface of a sphere in a certain way that obeys certain constraints, you run into a contradiction.

In 2006, Conway and Kochen used this to prove a stronger result. By combining it with the kinds of "EPR-style" entanglement experiments that won the 2022 Nobel Prize, they showed[1] that no such "lookup table" (i.e., hidden variables) approach could be made consistent with the observed results. That is, the "answer" that a particle gives upon measurement simply _cannot_ be a function of the information available to it. That is, the result is somehow completely "fresh."

To be clear, there _are_ still certain assumptions that must be made here. In particular, if you are not free to choose which experiments to conduct, then it might just be that something is _forcing_ you to make only the measurements that would make the predictions of QM _appear_ true. This would require a certain kind of "conspiracy" (although its proponents generally try to make it sound less spooky).

Because these results do not require any new physics, and experiments to prove them are "only" incremental changes to existing experiments, they are very unlikely to win any Nobel Prizes. But if you ask me, the discovery that the future is in some sense _fundamentally open_ is the most astonishing of all. That the structure of our reality permits us to _prove_ this fact is truly remarkable, and worth pondering.

As a fascinating bit of trivia, quantum computing professor Scott Aaronson --- then a 21 year-old student two years into his PhD --- independently discovered (almost) the same thing in 2002, but found it too obvious to bother publishing on its own: https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=85
