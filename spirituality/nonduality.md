# Emptiness, no-self, and nonduality

Teachings on the nondual nature of consciousness can be broken into stages of realization. Each stage is so profound that it feels unmistakably final. Moreover, the very nature of these insights is such that it provides one with a ready-made argument against even the _possibility_ of further progress. It often sounds something like this: "_I am Pure Consciousness; ideas of gain and loss can find no footing here_," or the rhetorical "_to whom does this dualistic idea of 'stages' occur?_"

This makes it essential to have a full map ahead of time. Otherwise, there is not only the very real risk of getting stuck for decades (or lifetimes), but also of spreading one's misunderstanding to many others. These risks are not merely hypothetical, but indeed very common in the spiritual scene today (as we shall see).

This piece is meant to be (part of) such a map. These are not my original ideas. I am deeply indebted to [Soh Wei Yu and John Tan](http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/) (and [their community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AwakeningToReality)) for tirelessly sharing these insights. Numerous serious practitioners have found them invaluable, and I hope you will, too.

This piece focuses on the teachings of nonduality, which are common to both Mahayana Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta (amongst others). Most of Theravada Buddhism does not take this route (and in fact often criticizes it), and in a separate piece we address whether it arrives at the same result. 

Because the Mahayana literature appears to have the most examples of the highest stage(s), we will use its perspective here. Nonetheless, it should be noted that there exist Mahayana lineages whose teachings do _not_ express the highest realization.

Two core tenets of Buddhism are useful to explain briefly at the outset. The doctrine of **no-self** (*anatta*) contradicts the apparently self-evident fact of there being an independently existing self (or Self). The tenet of **emptiness** (*sunyata*) goes even deeper, extending this truth of essencelessness to absolutely everything. Both doctrines are frequently misunderstood, as we shall see.

## Summary of the stages

### Stage 0: Pre-realization

At the start of the spiritual search, the practitioner feels completely identified with the body and mind. When there are happy thoughts, the practitioner "is" happy. When there are sad thoughts, the practitioner "is" sad. Whatever the contents of the mind, the practitioner feels identical to, or identified with, them. Therefore, the goal appears to be to calm the mind --- because when my *mind* is calm, *I* am calm.

### Stage 1: I AM

The practitioner becomes aware of an aspect of herself that's deeper and more fundamental than her thoughts. She notices that even when there are no thoughts, her *consciousness* is still present. Moreover, when thoughts return, her consciousness isn't sullied by them. It is more like a passive observer, allowing the contents of mind to freely come and go.

When realized in its fullness, there is a major paradigm shift, both regarding her self-identity and the very nature of reality. Pure consciousness is seen to be the One Real Thing, and she is That. The contents of consciousness --- which include not just thoughts but all sensory perception, and therefore the whole world --- are illusory and extraneous. Some call this God.

> *You are forever pure, you are forever true, and the dream of this world can never touch you.
> So give up your attachment; give up your illusion; and fly to that space that's beyond all illusion.* --- Shimshai

This is called "nonduality" because for the first time, it is not that _I_ recognize consciousness, but consciousness recognizes _itself_.

### Stage 2: One Mind

The first stage is fundamentally alienating: the contents of her experience --- i.e., her entire life --- are intrinsically *foreign* to her, and so she can never be truly intimate with them. Nonetheless, this state feels so much freer than before that she overlooks this "minor" detail. Moreover, it is so obviously _ultimate_ that there's no reason to look further.

Although it feels like emotions are being incorporated (by being *allowed* in the space of awareness), this is actually a form of avoidance. You are pure; they are not, and they can "never touch you." Deep emotional issues thus never get resolved, and so they recur with increasing intensity, forcing the practitioner to recede further back into the depths of "pure" consciousness for refuge.

A crisis may force the practitioner to look more closely. If the conditions are right, she will discover that the contents of consciousness were never actually separate from the space: instead, they are manifestations of it. Like the ocean and waves are not separate, neither are consciousness and its manifestations. She realizes, with a shock, that she is the whole world. God is All.

### Stage 3: No-self (anatta)

Stage 2 is characterized by a one-way dependency: there is One Ultimate Truth (usually stylized as Awareness) to which everything else reduces / from which everything springs / of which everything is made / etc. The individual self has merged back into the great Self, and there is obviously nothing whatsoever beyond this. There are not two; there is just this One.

Although this is extremely profound, there is still attachment to the idea of an ultimate essence. The one-way dependency must yield to full two-way dependency: things are nothing but Awareness, _and Awareness is nothing but those things_; a mere label for the fact that things appear. This habit of _inherency_ (of Awareness or Self) is much more subtle and difficult to uproot than the habit of duality. 

There is not only no individual self, but no transcendent Self. Reality is more like a spontaneous dance; a radically alive, primordially uncaused, miraculous, radiant expression, with no underlying essence that somehow _transcends_ this expression. This feels like neither Self nor Other, and even labels like Awareness become arbitrary and unnecessary.

## Distinguishing the stages

Now let's look at some quotes that exemplify the stages. (Emphasis always mine.)

### Stage one

Thai Forest patriarch [Ajahn Chah](
(https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/the_teachings_of_ajahn_chah_web.pdf)). Although he was a Buddhist teacher, here he is not expressing the full Buddhist insight:

> We become the ‘one who knows’. The mind and feeling are just like oil and water; they are in the same bottle but they don’t mix. We know the painful or comfortable states but we don’t identify with them. We stay only with peace: the peace beyond both comfort and pain.
> ... <p/>
> In its natural state, **the mind is [...] independent, existing in a state of purity** that is truly clear, radiant and untarnished. The purpose of the practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and investigating until you reach the original mind.
> ... <p/>
> We say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but **in fact they are by nature already separate**. Our realization is simply to know this **natural separateness** according to reality. When we say they are not separated it’s because we’re clinging to them through ignorance of the truth.

Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield:

> What’s left is enlightenment, always found here and now, a release of identification with the changing conditions of the world, a resting in awareness. This involves a simple yet profound shift of identity from the myriad, ever-changing conditioned states **to the unconditioned consciousness** — the awareness which knows them all.

This really does feel like "enlightenment." As Soh describes:

> [It is] a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from [it] because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of anatta.

Here we see a glimpse of why practitioners of Mahayana Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta may not be drawn to orthodox Buddhist teachings (which deny an ultimate self), and vice versa. To restore unity, people often reinterpret the Buddha to have been referring to only the _individual_ self. This is easy to do in Stage 2.

### Stage two

Author Sam Harris:

> [T]he duality collapses when you recognize that the contents are, in some basic sense, made of consciousness. ... [T]he claim [...] is often made that consciousness in some sense **transcends** its content... it does; it's the **prior condition** of anything that's appearing, but anything that does in fact appear is also of a piece with whatever consciousness is in itself.

Notice marker words like "prior" and "transcends." Mind is like an empty container that hosts ever-changing contents. This gives rise to a very common misinterpretation of _emptiness_.

Harris again:
> If I were a Hindu, I might think in terms of Brahman, the eternal Self, of which the world and all individual minds are thought to be a mere modification. If I were a Buddhist, I might talk about the “dharmakaya of **emptiness” in which all apparent things manifest**.

Nonduality teacher Judith Blackstone:
> Fundamental consciousness is experienced as luminous stillness, or **emptiness**. ... **Within this luminous, all-pervasive stillness** moves the constantly changing dance of our thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions. The more fully we come to **know ourselves as the stillness**, the more effortlessly, deeply and vividly the movement of life occurs and flows.

Philosopher Bernardo Kastrup:
> [I]n order to directly experience the nature of reality for himself; he might then find out that that **'emptiness' is mind at rest, a subject without objects**, pregnant with the potential for every conceivable internal relationship.

Nonduality teacher Ken Wilber:
> ... realizing your True Nature—which you can call God, Allah, Jahweh, Brahman, Tao, Ein Sof—it doesn’t really matter, because the core of the Big Mind Process is **Emptiness itself, which, having no specific content** at all, can and does embrace anything that arises, integrating it all.

Nonduality teacher Robert Adams:

> So empty yourself out totally and completely. Emptiness is realization. Emptiness is Brahman. Emptiness is the Self. Emptiness is your real nature.

Notice the recurring theme: we are the stillness; the emptiness; the ultimate Self; a subject that transcends all objects. But this is not what *sunyata* (emptiness) means in Buddhism. 

Buddhist practitioner-scholar Karl Brunnholzl:

> Emptiness means that things do not exist as they seem, but are like illusions and like dreams.

Teacher Rob Burbea:

> So in technical language, we can say emptiness is the realization that nothing whatsoever – nothing – has any what we call ‘inherent existence,’ any independent existence.

In Buddhism, absolutely everything --- including *consciousness* --- is "empty." Not in the sense of being *devoid of content*, but in the (admittedly unusual) sense of *not having inherent existence*. In particular, "consciousness" is not the container or Self that it so clearly seems to be.

The other common mistake at this stage is to believe that this is what the Buddha meant by *anatta*, because the *individual* self is seen through in favor of a universal Self.

Harris:

> Consciousness [...] does not feel like a self. ... If I were a Hindu, I might talk about “Brahman,” the **eternal Self**.

[Blackstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyb5_kqNXB8):
> So instead of "I am Judith" and "I am a teacher" [...] we have this experience, this nonverbal experience, which we can say is no-self because it's not that [...] autobiographical self. But there is this **underlying experience** and **we could call it Self**, we can call it no-self, I don't think it matters.

But it is this very sense of an "underlying experience" --- and not what we call it --- that is the core illusion.

Kastrup (emphasis his):
> People think that in Buddhism there is no self, but actually what is really meant is that there is no *individual*, stand-alone self.

And:
> Literally everything can be **reduced** to the **ultimate subject** of experience.

Wilber:
> When we realize that there is always no self (and this is happening right now) we realize that **our true identity** is always the **Supreme Identity**.

But this idea of a Universal Self was already well-known at the time of the Buddha. Why did he take such great pains to differentiate his teaching if it's really the same?

### Stage 3

Zen master Thích Nhất Hạnh (*[The Buddhist Understanding of Reality](https://www.mindfulnessbell.org/archive/2015/01/dharma-talk-the-buddhist-understanding-of-reality-2)*):
> Without subject, there is no object; **without object, there is no subject**. They manifest at the same time. ... **[T]he notion of a permanent consciousness is illusion, not reality**.

This is what it means to say that consciousness is "empty." Not that it is devoid of _content_, but of _intrinsic, standalone existence_ --- and yet somehow, this doesn't prevent it from spontaneously manifesting in all its unquestionable glory. This may sound like a minor detail, but the difference is Heaven and Earth. It is only _after_ one stops grasping at a subtle essence that one discovers one was still grasping.

[The Royal Seal of Mahamudra](https://www.amazon.com/Royal-Seal-Mahamudra-Realization-Coemergence/dp/1559394374):

> All phenomena of **subject and object** are unoriginated, nonabiding, and unceasing. To know this crucial point and to have the experience and conviction born from deep within that they are **devoid of true essence or nature** is what, at this point, should be defined as vipashyana [insight].

Practitioners at this stage generally eschew terms like "Awareness," since it hints at a true essence. Unfortunately, attaining this stage seems to be rare, even within the Buddhist community.

## A note on Theravada and vipassana

It should be noted that not all Buddhist paths go through all of these stages. Some seem to stop part-way, while others take a different route entirely. In particular, the Theravada tradition (except for certain Thai lineages) tends to eschew any talk of "pure consciousness," because it seems to contradict _anatta_:

> I noticed that many Buddhists trained under the doctrine of anatta and emptiness seem to be put off by the description of “I AM realization” [stage one] as it seems to contradict anatta. This will prevent their progress as they will fail to appreciate and realize the depth of luminous presence, and their understanding of anatta and emptiness remains intellectual. It should be understood that the I AM realization does not contradict Anatta realization but complements it. It is the “original face before your parents were born” of Zen, and the unfabricated clarity in Dzogchen that serves as initial rigpa, it is also the initial certainty of Mind discovered in the first of the four yogas of Mahamudra. ... [it] is a direct taste and realization of the Mind of Clear Light. The view gets refined and the taste gets brought to effortless maturity and non-contrivance in all manifestation as one’s insights deepen. ... [T]here is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature.

Such practitioners may eventually discover other routes to the same goal, however. 
A good example is Buddhist teacher Daniel Ingram, who spent decades doing the Theravada practice of vipassana. By his account, he was stamped as *done* by a lineage-holder in the Mahasi tradition in Burma some time around 2003, and was authorized to teach it.

In 2009, he felt confident that the Tibetan Buddhist realization of the mind's true nature (*rigpa*) did not go beyond his own realization (arahatship, the goal of Theravada):

> *Kenneth [Folk], who says Rigpa and arahatship are two different phenomena, seems to think that with arahatship, one has the best platform to stabilize Rigpa, whereas I claim that arahatship is Rigpa, stabilized and done without other options.*

Then, in 2011, [he encountered a practice](https://www.integrateddaniel.info/my-experiments-in-actualism/) that would deepen his realization. He describes the result here (emphasis mine):

> [I]t did do something totally remarkable, and that was create the ability to sit totally at rest, totally at peace, just like that, and I don't mean in some stage or state, not in some jhana, just by the field being nice to itself. That simple thing was well worth the work it took to get it. **It doesn't sound as fancy or as flashy as all the other stuff I have done, but it is more valuable than them all.**

This kind of *total simplicity* lines up well with certain aspects of how the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition might describe *rigpa*. He goes on to say:

> I was just talking to a heavy Vajrayana [Tibetan Buddhist] practitioner about all of this at Buddhist Geeks, and she made the comment that I had attained to Vajrayana results with Theravadan methods.

AtR interprets what happened like so:

> As for whether I AM phase can be bypassed, the answer is yes, but one will tend to overlook certain aspects. For example Daniel Ingram’s [book] Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha does not go through I AM (…) before the fourth path, however, as [John Tan] wrote in 2009, “… I think what lacks in the approach of MCTB is an effective way to allow practitioners to have adequate experience of the vividness, realness and presence of Awareness and the full experience of these qualities in the transience.” … This is also the reason why Daniel needed to go through Actual Freedom practice to bring out the luminosity aspect further even though he had certain insights into anatta in MCTB 4th path.

In other words, even if one does not progress through the stages of nonduality as described as above, one must ultimately find a way to integrate the same insights --- in particular, the radical aliveness at the heart of reality --- to avoid falling into nihilism.

Could vipassana practice be enough? Ingram is asked this question [here](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/11355316):

> J.C.: Why the need to experiment with all sorts of practices? Why the need for the switch to Zen, Vajrayana, prayer, Catholic devotional practices, martial arts, magickal practices, and so on?
>
> Why not just continue to observe exactly what's going on in the present moment and see the Three Characteristics?
>
> Why isn't that enough?

He answers:

> Well, it could be enough, sort of. The Three Characteristics are profound, very profound, staggeringly profound, and not easily grasped in their entirety. It seems perfectly reasonable to grasp them in their entirety by observing them, but there is a problem, actually, that last line contains a bunch of problems that are not obvious until you see them clearly.
>
> I will go by the words in that last line to illustrate the problem.
>
> "Continue": there is no continuing. There is nothing to continue, no past that could be continued, no future to continue into, and this moment is entirely ungraspable. No sensation could ever actually grasp or continue. Everything is fresh but perfectly ephemeral. The notion of continuing, from a high insight point of view, is a serious problem. Instead, there has to be a deep non-grasping, a perfect and flawless appreciation of non-continuing, a deep never could be a continuing, a deep nothing could ever be continuing, a deep sense of not only discontinuity, but of the utter flowing, vanishing, empty transience of anything that seemed to be able to continue. One must figure out how to go beyond continuing, beyond grasping, beyond that strange mental illusion that such a thing could ever occur or have occurred.
>
> "Observe": there is no observing. There can be no observing. There is nothing that can observe at all. Everything is just occurring where it is, naturally, straightforwardly. There is no observer. There can't be any observer. There never was any observer. Deeply understanding this is required. There never was any observation. Observation can't finally do it. One must figure out how to shift out of observing to just phenomena occurring.
>
> The qualifier "in the present moment" is a problem in some way. This almost always involves some subtle or gross pattern of sensations that we refer to mentally when we say "now", or "the present", which are not actually stable, not actually a present, not actually anything but more empty transience, yet we make them seem like a stable present. This is very subtle, deep, profound. Even "the present" doesn't withstand scrutiny, and we must be careful with this sticky concept, as it can itself become a sort of a solidified thing, part of the illusion of continuity, observation, practitioner, etc.
>
> So, while it is true that deeply comprehending emptiness, non-continuity, non-observation, and even non-present, can occur by just continuously observing this present moment, we must be careful, and sometimes it takes people shifting out of their trench of "good practice" to do something that is out from good practice and instead is just the unfolding empty wisdom dharma. Various people find various methods to make this subtle shift, and one size definitely does not fit all, so best wishes sorting out what will help you work out your salvation with diligence.

It is my hope that sharing this map helps practitioners avoid these traps.
