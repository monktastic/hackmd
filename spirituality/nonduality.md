# Emptiness, no-self, and nonduality

Teachings on the nondual nature of consciousness can be very tricky. The overall path can be broken into several stages of realization, where each stage is so much more profound than the last that it feels _unmistakably_ final. Moreover, the nature of the insights is such that they provide a bulletproof argument against even the _possibility_ of there being more to see: one often hears "_I am Pure Consciousness; ideas of gain and loss can find no footing here_," or the rhetorical "_to whom does the dualistic idea of 'stages' occur?_"

As a result, there is not only the risk to the practitioner of getting stuck for decades (or lifetimes), but also of spreading their misunderstanding to many others. These risks are not merely hypothetical, but indeed very common in the spiritual scene today (as we shall see). This makes it essential to have a full map ahead of time. This piece is meant to be (part of) such a map.

These are not my original ideas. I am deeply indebted to [Soh Wei Yu and John Tan](http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/) (and [their community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AwakeningToReality)) for tirelessly sharing these insights. Numerous serious practitioners have found them invaluable, and I hope you will, too.

Teachings of nonduality exist in both Mahayana Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta (amongst others). Most of Theravada Buddhism does not take this route (and in fact often criticizes it), and in a separate piece we address whether it arrives at the same result. 

Because the Mahayana literature appears to have the most examples of the highest stage(s), we will use its perspective here. Nonetheless, it should be noted that there also exist Mahayana lineages whose teachings do _not_ presently express the highest realization.

Two core tenets of Buddhism are useful to explain briefly at the outset. The doctrine of **no-self** (*anatta*) contradicts the apparently self-evident fact of there being an independently existing self (or Self). The tenet of **emptiness** (*sunyata*) goes even deeper, extending this truth of essencelessness to absolutely everything. Both doctrines are frequently misunderstood, as we shall see.

## Summary of the stages

### Stage 0: Pre-realization

At the start of the spiritual search, the practitioner feels completely identified with the body and mind. When there are happy thoughts, the practitioner "is" happy. When there are sad thoughts, the practitioner "is" sad. Whatever the contents of the mind, the practitioner feels identical to, or identified with, them. Therefore, the goal appears to be to calm the mind — because when my *mind* is calm, *I* am calm.

### Stage 1: I AM

The practitioner becomes aware of an aspect of herself that's deeper and more fundamental than her thoughts. She notices that even when there are no thoughts, her *consciousness* is still present. Moreover, when thoughts return, her consciousness isn't sullied by them. It is more like a passive observer, allowing the contents of mind to freely come and go.

When realized in its fullness, there is a major paradigm shift, both regarding her self-identity and the very nature of reality. Pure consciousness is seen to be the One Real Thing, and she is That. The contents of consciousness — which include not just thoughts but all sensory perception, and therefore the whole world — are illusory and extraneous. She is the sky, and the contents are mere clouds. Some call this God-consciousness.

> *You are forever pure, you are forever true, and the dream of this world can never touch you.<p/>
> So give up your attachment; give up your illusion; and fly to that space that's beyond all illusion.* — Shimshai (spiritual musician)

This is called "nonduality" because for the first time, it is not that _I_ recognize consciousness, but that consciousness recognizes _itself_.

### Stage 2: One Mind

The first stage is fundamentally alienating: the contents of her experience — i.e., her entire life — are intrinsically *foreign* to her, and so she can never be truly intimate with them. Nonetheless, this state feels so much freer than before that she overlooks this "minor" detail. Moreover, it is so obviously _ultimate_ that there's no reason to look further.

Although it feels like emotions are being incorporated (by being *allowed* in the loving space of awareness), this is actually a form of avoidance. You are pure; they are not, and they can "never touch you." Deep emotional issues thus never get resolved, and they recur with increasing intensity, forcing the practitioner to recede further back into the depths of "pure" consciousness for refuge.

A crisis may eventually force the practitioner to look more closely. If the conditions are right, she will discover that the contents of consciousness were never actually separate from the space: instead, they are manifestations of it. Like the ocean and waves are not separate, neither are consciousness and its manifestations. She realizes, with a shock, that she is the whole world. God is All.

### Stage 3: No-self (anatta)

Stage 2 is characterized by a one-way dependency: there is One Ultimate Truth (usually stylized as Awareness) to which everything else reduces / from which everything springs / of which everything is made / etc. Waves cannot exist without the ocean, but the ocean can exist without waves. The individual self has merged back into the great Self, and there is obviously nothing whatsoever beyond this. There are not two; there is just this One.

Although this is extremely profound, there is still attachment to the idea of an ultimate essence. The one-way dependency must yield to full two-way dependency: things are nothing but Awareness, _and Awareness is nothing but those things_; a mere label for the fact that things appear. This habit of _inherency_ (of Awareness Self / Mind / God) is much more subtle and difficult to uproot than the habit of duality. 

There is not only no individual self, but no transcendent Self. Reality is more like a spontaneous dance; a radically alive, primordially uncaused, miraculous, radiant expression, with no underlying essence that somehow _transcends_ that expression. This feels like neither Self nor Other, and even labels like Awareness become arbitrary and unnecessary.

## Distinguishing the stages

Now let's look at some quotes that exemplify the stages. (Emphasis always mine.)

### Stage one

Thai Forest patriarch [Ajahn Chah](
(https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/the_teachings_of_ajahn_chah_web.pdf)). Although he was a Buddhist teacher, here he is not expressing the full Buddhist insight:

> We become the ‘one who knows’. The mind and feeling are just like oil and water; they are in the same bottle but they don’t mix. We know the painful or comfortable states but we don’t identify with them. We stay only with peace: the peace beyond both comfort and pain.
> ... <p/>
> In its natural state, **the mind is [...] independent, existing in a state of purity** that is truly clear, radiant and untarnished. The purpose of the practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and investigating until you reach the original mind.
> ... <p/>
> We say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but **in fact they are by nature already separate**. Our realization is simply to know this **natural separateness** according to reality. When we say they are not separated it’s because we’re clinging to them through ignorance of the truth.

Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield:

> What’s left is enlightenment, always found here and now, a release of identification with the changing conditions of the world, a resting in awareness. This involves a simple yet profound shift of identity from the myriad, ever-changing conditioned states **to the unconditioned consciousness** — the awareness which knows them all.

This really does feel like "enlightenment." As Soh describes:

> [It is] a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from [it] because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of anatta.

Hakuin Zenji (1686 - 1769), father of the Rinzai Zen lineage:

> The rank of "The Apparent within the Real" denotes the rank of the Absolute, the rank in which one experiences the Great Death, shouts "KA!" sees Tao, and enters into the Principle. ... This is the state of total empty solidity, without sound and without odor, like a bottomless clear pool. It is as if every fleck of cloud had been wiped from the vast sky. 
> 
> Too often the disciple, considering that his attainment of this rank is the end of the Great Matter and his discernment of the Buddha-way complete, clings to it to the death and will not let go of it.

### Stage two

In Stage 2, the apparent duality between consciousness and its contents collapses. Nonetheless, this is a one-way dependency: contents are nothing but consciousness, but consciousness _transcends_ its contents. It is the One Special Thing and therefore deserves a special name.

> _The world is illusory, Only Brahman is real, Brahman is the world._ — Sri Ramana Maharshi

Author Sam Harris:

> [T]he duality collapses when you recognize that the contents are, in some basic sense, made of consciousness. ... [T]he claim [...] is often made that consciousness in some sense **transcends** its content... it does; it's the **prior condition** of anything that's appearing, but anything that does in fact appear is also of a piece with whatever consciousness is in itself.

Harris is not making a metaphysical claim here, but experientially, consciousness is _prior to_ and _transcends_ its contents in the same way that Brahman transcends the world. In this way, it is conceptualized as a sort of empty space in which things manifest.

Harris again:
> If I were a Hindu, I might think in terms of Brahman, the eternal Self, of which the world and all individual minds are thought to be a mere modification. If I were a Buddhist, I might talk about the “dharmakaya of **emptiness” in which all apparent things manifest**.

Nonduality teacher Judith Blackstone:
> Fundamental consciousness is experienced as luminous stillness, or **emptiness**. ... **Within this luminous, all-pervasive stillness** moves the constantly changing dance of our thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions. The more fully we come to **know ourselves as the stillness**, the more effortlessly, deeply and vividly the movement of life occurs and flows.

Philosopher Bernardo Kastrup:
> [I]n order to directly experience the nature of reality for himself; he might then find out that that **'emptiness' is mind at rest, a subject without objects**, pregnant with the potential for every conceivable internal relationship.

Nonduality teacher Ken Wilber:
> ... realizing your True Nature—which you can call God, Allah, Jahweh, Brahman, Tao, Ein Sof—it doesn’t really matter, because the core of the Big Mind Process is **Emptiness itself, which, having no specific content** at all, can and does embrace anything that arises, integrating it all.

Notice the recurring theme: we are the stillness; the emptiness; the ultimate Self; a subject that transcends all objects. But this is not what *sunyata* (emptiness) means in Buddhism. 

The Dalai Lama:

> It is important to clarify that we are not speaking of emptiness as some kind of absolute stratum of reality, akin to, say, the ancient Indian concept of Brahman, which is conceived to be an underlying absolute reality from which the illusory world of multiplicity emerges. Emptiness is not a core reality, lying somehow at the heart of the universe, from which the diversity of phenomena arise.

Then what is it? Buddhist practitioner-scholar Karl Brunnholzl:

> Emptiness means that things do not exist as they seem, but are like illusions and like dreams.

Teacher Rob Burbea (possibly the [greatest expositor of emptiness](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/55vryt/insight_rob_burbea_seeing_that_frees/) in modern times):

> So in technical language, we can say emptiness is the realization that nothing whatsoever – nothing – has any what we call ‘inherent existence,’ any independent existence.

In Buddhism, absolutely everything — including *consciousness* — is "empty." Not in the sense of being *devoid of content*, but in the (admittedly unusual) sense of *not having inherent existence*. In particular, "consciousness" is not the fundamentally existent background or principle it so clearly seems to be in this stage.

The other common mistake is to believe that this is what the Buddha meant by *anatta*, because the *individual* self has been seen through in favor of a universal Self.

Harris:

> Consciousness [...] does not feel like a self. ... If I were a Hindu, I might talk about “Brahman,” the **eternal Self**.

[Blackstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyb5_kqNXB8):
> So instead of "I am Judith" and "I am a teacher" [...] we have this experience, this nonverbal experience, which we can say is no-self because it's not that [...] autobiographical self. But there is this **underlying experience** and **we could call it Self**, we can call it no-self, I don't think it matters.

But it is this very sense of an "underlying experience" — and not what we call it — that is the core illusion.

Kastrup (emphasis his):
> People think that in Buddhism there is no self, but actually what is really meant is that there is no *individual*, stand-alone self.

And:
> Literally everything can be **reduced** to the **ultimate subject** of experience.

Wilber:
> When we realize that there is always no self (and this is happening right now) we realize that **our true identity** is always the **Supreme Identity**.

But this idea of a Universal Self was already well-known at the time of the Buddha. Why did he take such great pains to differentiate his teaching if it's really the same?

Hakuin:

> Mind and the objects of mind are one and the same; things and oneself are not two. ... But if the student, having reached this state, were to be satisfied with it, then, as before, he would be living in the deep pit of "fixation in a lesser rank of bodhisattvahood".

### Stage 3

We normally walk around with the (mostly unconscious) assumption that the world we experience — this collection of sights, sounds, smells, etc. — is "backed" by a real world "out there." When Stage 2 is realized in its full depth, we see that both our experienced world and our ideas about any "real world" behind it are made of the same fundamental principle (Awareness or God) which we _are_.

Put into words, this realization is not very profound: sure, our _ideas_ of a real world are made of consciousness, but obviously that doesn't preclude there actually _being_ a real world outside of consciousness. What we cannot presently see is that the mind is playing a very subtle trick here around distinctions like real and unreal; inside and outside; etc.

It is impossible to overstate the astonishment that occurs once this trick is seen through. We suddenly discover that we've been overlooking the impossibly wondrous glory right under our noses in favor of an abstract lifeless principle we ironically called "reality." We now see that _consciousness_ is the realest possible thing. Even when it is unmanifest, it lies in wait, ready to express itself as the Cosmos. (The Realness of consciousness was already realized in Stage 1, but only as an invisible background. In Stage 2, it includes all the "contents.")

Stage 3 is even more radical. Awareness cannot transcend manifestation any more than the wind can transcend blowing: they are merely different words for the same principle. Another way of saying this is that the subtle sense of transcendence is seen to itself be "manifestation."

This isn't just a semantic trick: the difference between this and Stage 2 is like heaven and earth. Whereas before one still had a reliable touchstone, now one is hurtling through _pure paradox_. Far from being nihilistic or life-denying, it is _miraculous beyond description_; as though one has front-row seats to the Greatest Show on Earth: a seeming-something-from-nothing magic trick that never began and yet somehow never lets up. (To be clear, this is your experience _right now_ and at all "times" — though you may still be relegating this Miracle to a distant past, which we collectively know as the "Big Bang." But it is right under your nose.)

Nonetheless, practitioners at Stage 2 are generally unable to even consider this as a possibility, considering the very idea "just another manifestation of Awareness." The notion of a fixed God is the hardest of all to give up — though one could certainly be forgiven for repurposing that word to describe this wonder of wonders.

To get a taste of how hard it can be to differentiate Stage 2 from Stage 3 from the written word, consider this Stage 2 insight from Ken Wilber:

> ... all subjects and all objects have disappeared. The mountain is still the mountain, but it is not an object being looked at, and I am not a separate subject staring at it. Both I and the mountain arise in simple, **ever-present awareness**, and we are both set free in that clearing, we are both liberated in that nondual space, we are both enlightened in the opening that is **ever-present awareness**.

Now compare it with this Stage 3 description from Zen master Thích Nhất Hạnh (*[The Buddhist Understanding of Reality](https://www.mindfulnessbell.org/archive/2015/01/dharma-talk-the-buddhist-understanding-of-reality-2)*):
> Without subject, there is no object; without object, there is no subject. They manifest at the same time. ... **[T]he notion of a permanent consciousness is illusion, not reality**.

Both quotes say that subject and object are temporary illusions. But the former talks about this happening within an "ever-present awareness," while the latter says that any such "permanent consciousness" is actually an illusion. The views may sound similar, but are _vastly_ different in direct experience.

This is what it means to say that consciousness is "empty." Not that it is devoid of _content_, but of _intrinsic, standalone existence_ — and yet somehow, this doesn't prevent it from spontaneously manifesting in all its undeniable glory.

[The Royal Seal of Mahamudra](https://www.amazon.com/Royal-Seal-Mahamudra-Realization-Coemergence/dp/1559394374):

> All phenomena of **subject and object** are unoriginated, nonabiding, and unceasing. To know this crucial point and to have the experience and conviction born from deep within that they are **devoid of true essence or nature** is what, at this point, should be defined as vipashyana [insight].

[Rob Burbea](http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/07/realizing-nature-of-mind.html):

> The Buddha in a lovely quote, said, “Consciousness, when examined, is empty, void, without substance.” Now if we just stop the quote there, that could sound like the vast, spacious, insubstantial awareness. But he doesn't finish there. He goes on to say, “Like a magician’s trick, like an illusion.” In other words there’s some hocus pocus going in the mind, and baadaabim baadaaboom – there’s awareness. And it’s a trick. It doesn’t actually exist as something real. Consciousness, the Buddha says, is like a magician’s trick, like an illusion, and in the formal Dharma language, it lacks inherent existence.

And:

> It is not that while everything else is fabricated by the mind, the mind itself is somehow real, a really existing basis for the fabrication. The mind, whether conceived as mental processes or 'Awareness'—even the awareness that we can know as vast and unperturbed, that seems natural and effortless—is also fabricated in the process. We find, in the end, that there is no 'ground' to fabrication.

Hakuin:

> Were anyone to try to indicate his mind, it would be no more existent than the horns of a rabbit or the hairs of a tortoise that have gone beyond the farthest mountain.

As the Buddha said, this, just this, is the end of suffering.

To close this piece, I would like to share my favorite riddle / poem:

> *So close you can't see it <br/>
> So deep you can't fathom it <br/>
> So simple you can't believe it <br/>
> So good you can't accept it* <br/>
-- Tibetan Buddhist saying
