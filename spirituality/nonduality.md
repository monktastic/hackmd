# Ground and groundlessness

According to the [Perennial Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perennial_philosophy), all religions (or at least their mystical traditions) ultimately point to the same ultimate Truth: that of a transcendent "Godhead or Ground, which is the unmanifested principle of all manifestation." On the other hand, Buddhism claims that this Ground—infinitely wondrous though it is—must itself be transcended to reveal _groundlessness_, which is vastly freer still.

Is this "groundlessness" just another way of speaking about the same ineffable Truth, or is it meaningfully different? Should the beginning aspirant even care? Can't they just sort it all out later?

If the Buddhists are correct, then having the "right view" matters a great deal right from the outset. Otherwise, once the Godhead is realized, it becomes nearly impossible to release when the time comes, so that one may discover the unspeakable paradox that lies beyond.

Regardless of which philosophy is correct, there are indeed two radically different modes of experience worth exploring here which, over the centuries, have unfortunately become conflated into one. In this piece, we will try to tease them apart.

These are not my original ideas. I am deeply indebted to [Soh Wei Yu and John Tan](http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/) (and [their community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/AwakeningToReality)) for tirelessly sharing these insights. Numerous serious practitioners have found them invaluable, and I hope you will, too.

We will look through the lens of the Mahayana school of Buddhism, because the other major school (Theravada) takes a different route, and does not address the Godhead question as directly. 

There are various ways to break the Mahayana path into stages of realization, but we will focus on three common stages:

1. "I AM": The practitioner realizes that consciousness—her true identity—is primordial and untouchable by its passing contents.
2. True Self / Godhead: She realizes that the contents are actually made of consciousness too. (This is the Perennial Philosophy.)
3. No self / groundlessness: The container / contents duality collapses; consciousness does not transcend its "contents" but _is_ precisely them. The permanent background is seen to be an illusion—the most compelling one of all—leaving no stable reference point for identity to crystallize around.

As we shall see, even within Buddhism, some teachers and lineages seem to top at stage one or two.

---

It is useful to explain two core tenets of Buddhism briefly at the outset. The doctrine of **no-self** (*anatman*) contradicts the apparently self-evident fact of there being an independently existing individual self (or universal Self). The tenet of **emptiness** (*sunyata*) goes even deeper, extending this truth of essencelessness to absolutely everything. In this piece, we have lumped both realizations into stage three. 

Both doctrines are frequently misunderstood, which is the reason that stages two and three are so often conflated.

---

## Unpacking the stages

Let's start at the beginning. At first, the practitioner finds herself feeling like a body and mind navigating a fundamentally external reality. In both Mahayana Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta, instructions are given to turn the light of awareness in on itself, to discover "that which is looking."

[quotes]


### Stage 1: I AM

With careful enough practice, there will come a point where the practitioner suddenly realizes that she is not a person having an experience, but _pure eternal consciousness_ having the experience of being a person. This is a paradigm-shattering revelation, and can be considered one's first awakening.

Buddhist Thai Forest patriarch [Ajahn Chah](
(https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/the_teachings_of_ajahn_chah_web.pdf)):

> We become the ‘one who knows’. The mind and feeling are just like oil and water; they are in the same bottle but they don’t mix. We know the painful or comfortable states but we don’t identify with them. We stay only with peace: the peace beyond both comfort and pain.
> ... <p/>
> **In its natural state, the mind is [...] independent, existing in a state of purity** that is truly clear, radiant and untarnished. The purpose of the practice, then, is to seek inwardly, searching and investigating until you reach the original mind.
> ... <p/>
> We say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but **in fact they are by nature already separate**. Our realization is simply to know this **natural separateness** according to reality. When we say they are not separated it’s because we’re clinging to them through ignorance of the truth.

Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield:

> What’s left is enlightenment, always found here and now, a release of identification with the changing conditions of the world, a resting in awareness. This involves a simple yet profound shift of identity from the myriad, ever-changing conditioned states to the unconditioned consciousness — the awareness which knows them all.

Notice the common theme: what you are (consciousness) is fundamentally separate, pure, and untouchable by its impure contents. What these descriptions do not capture is the utter astonishment of discovering a principle that is "realer than real." It is self-evidently the very _ground of existence_—and although it seems transparent in one sense, it also has a sense of being infinitely bright.

This can certainly _feel_ like "enlightenment," but is actually far from it. As Soh describes:

> [It is] a conviction so powerful that no one, not even Buddha can sway you from [it] because the practitioner so clearly sees the truth of it. It is the direct and unshakable insight of ‘You’. This is the realization that a practitioner must have in order to realize the Zen satori. You will understand clearly why it is so difficult for those practitioners to forgo this ‘I AMness’ and accept the doctrine of anatta (no-self).

Hakuin Zenji (1686 - 1769), father of the Rinzai Zen lineage:

> This is the state of total empty solidity, without sound and without odor, like a bottomless clear pool. It is as if every fleck of cloud had been wiped from the vast sky.  Too often the disciple, considering that his attainment of this rank is the end of the Great Matter and his discernment of the Buddha-way complete, clings to it to the death and will not let go of it.

The Royal Seal of Mahamudra, a Tibetan Buddhist text (emphasis mine):

> The essence of one’s mind is an unidentifiable void; it is the primordial cognizance that has not been fabricated. In the mind that is aware of itself and lucid by itself, these two, void and cognizance, are inseparable. To gain the experience that the mind has ascertained that it is so **is a beginner’s [insight]**. By sustaining just that much at the beginning, we are confident that unmistaken [insight] will gradually arise.

Some teachers call this stage "nonduality" because the subject—pure consciousness—becomes _aware of itself_ for the first time. Nonetheless, it is a strong form of duality. But with the right pointers, the practitioner may begin to detect that this sense of separation is an illusion.

### Stage 2: True Self / Godhead

Author Sam Harris describes the next transition beautifully:

> [T]he duality collapses when you recognize that the contents are, in some basic sense, made of consciousness.
 
This is another huge paradigm shift: the contents don't merely float _through_ me; they are somehow _made of_ me! That is, consciousness isn't merely a passive observer of appearances, but is more like a lively substance that takes shape _as_ appearances. Yet it also _transcends_ those appearances. Harris again (emphasis mine):

> [T]he claim [...] is often made that consciousness in some sense **transcends** its content... it does; it's the **prior** condition of anything that's appearing, but anything that does in fact appear is also of a piece with whatever consciousness is in itself.

In Advaita Vedanta, this transcendent Consciousness (note the capitalization—because it is unique and special) is called Brahman (the Godhead). Swami Sarvapriyananda describes it this way:

> The world entirely depends on Brahman but Brahman does not depend on the world. Brahman has no relationship with the world.

Notice the asymmetry. Prof. Haridas Chaudhuri, in The Concept of Brahman in Hindu Philosophy:

> The relation between Brahman and the world, if we can speak of any relation at all, is an asymmetrical one, because even though the world is pervaded by Brahman, Brahman cannot be said to be pervaded by the world. The world is a form of appearance of Brahman, but appearances cannot be said to be the stuff of which Brahman is made.

This is _asymmetrical nonduality_. This asymmetry can be hard to detect in writing. For example, consider this quote from nonduality philosopher / teacher Ken Wilber:

> All subjects and all objects have disappeared. The mountain is still the mountain, but it is not an object being looked at, and I am not a separate subject staring at it. 

So far, this sounds symmetrical. But he continues (emphasis mine):

> Both I and the mountain arise **in simple, ever-present awareness**, and we are both set free in that clearing, we are both liberated in that nondual space, we are both enlightened in **the opening that is ever-present awareness**.

The _individual_ subject has disappeared, but the _pure, transcendent, eternal_ subject—the "space of awareness"—ever remains.

Arvind Sharma, in _The Experiential Dimension of Advaita Vedanta_, elucidates this distinction between "true self" (or Universal Self) and "objectified self" (personal self):

> According to Advaita, the pure subject is our true self whose knowledge is liberative, while all the while we function with the objectified self—that is, with a self which is the subject in a subject-object relationship in the course of ordinary living. If the subject could be realised in its purity then all misery would cease: this is called self-knowledge.

Philosopher Bernardo Kastrup:

> Literally everything can be reduced to the **ultimate subject** of experience.

Objects cannot exist without subject, but Subject exists independently of objects.

Hakuin:

> Mind and the objects of mind are one and the same; things and oneself are not two... But if the student, having reached this state, were to be satisfied with it, then, as before, he would be living in the deep pit of "fixation in a lesser rank of bodhisattvahood."

### Stage 3: No-self (anatman / anatta)

Stage two is already a high stage of realization—but there is still one final step to take: the Godhead must somehow release itself from the illusion of inherency. This is tricky business, because it is so self-evidently Real and Ultimate: after all, whenever it looks for itself, there it is! It never suspects that It may be continually dreaming Itself into existence.

When the bottom finally drops out, the asymmetry is thoroughly dissolved: appearances are consciousness, _and consciousness is seen to be nothing but appearances_. "Consciousness" is not a standalone phenomenon, but a simple label for the fact that anything appears at all.

Zen master Thích Nhất Hạnh (*[The Buddhist Understanding of Reality](https://www.mindfulnessbell.org/archive/2015/01/dharma-talk-the-buddhist-understanding-of-reality-2)*):
> Without subject, there is no object; without object, there is no subject. They manifest at the same time.

This sounds like the Wilber quote above ("All subjects and all objects have disappeared..."). But rather than affirming an "ever-present awareness," he continues:

> [T]he notion of a permanent consciousness is illusion, not reality.

This is a *vastly* different experience. Consciousness does not "precede" or "transcend" or "host" appearances; it IS precisely those appearances, and nothing else besides.

[Rob Burbea](http://www.awakeningtoreality.com/2009/07/realizing-nature-of-mind.html), perhaps the [clearest expositor of Mahayana in modern times](https://www.reddit.com/r/streamentry/comments/55vryt/insight_rob_burbea_seeing_that_frees/):

> The Buddha, in a lovely quote, said “consciousness, when examined, is empty, void, without substance.” Now if we just stop the quote there, that could sound like the vast, spacious, insubstantial awareness. But he doesn't finish there. He goes on to say “like a magician’s trick, like an illusion.” In other words there’s some hocus pocus going in the mind, and badabim badaboom—there’s awareness. And it’s a trick. It doesn’t actually exist as something real. Consciousness, the Buddha says, is like a magician’s trick, like an illusion, and in the formal Dharma language, it lacks inherent existence.

And:

> It is not that while everything else is fabricated by the mind, the mind itself is somehow real, a really existing basis for the fabrication. The mind, whether conceived as mental processes or 'Awareness'—even the awareness that we can know as vast and unperturbed, that seems natural and effortless—is also fabricated in the process. We find, in the end, that **there is no 'ground'** to fabrication.

Hakuin:

> Were anyone to try to indicate his mind, it would be no more existent than the horns of a rabbit or the hairs of a tortoise that have gone beyond the farthest mountain.

---

Now let us try to bring the distinction between stages two and three out of the abstract and into the experiential.

### Detachment vs intimacy

Stage two emphasizes _detachment_ from the world. 

Adi Shankara, founder of Advaita Vedanta (speaking as Brahman):
> I am eternally **pure and detached**. I am formless, imperishable. I manifest myself as the Perfect Bliss. I am that absolute I. — (as translated in A History of The Dasnami Naga Sannyasis)

Advaita guru [Pravrajika Brahmaprana](http://www.vedantadfw.org/PravrajikaBrahmaprana.php):

> [T]he higher Self remains the **detached witness** to all these foolish shenanigans. At the same time, the Self makes them all possible by providing the mind with the light of consciousness, without which maya (illusion) could not exist. — in ["Consciousness in Advaita Vedanta"](https://www.hindupedia.com/en/Consciousness_in_Advaita_Vedanta)

Musician Shimshai, roughly translating an ancient Hindu hymn:

> You are forever pure, you are forever true, and the dream of this world can never touch you.<p/>
> So give up your attachment; give up your confusion, and fly to that space that's beyond all illusion.<p/> 

Because Brahman _transcends_ its appearances, it is eternally detached from (and indifferent to) them. In no-self realization, on the other hand, there is radical intimacy and interdependence. There is no transcendent space to fly off to: This Is It, and insofar as "you" means anything, you are precisely This.

Read Thich Nhat Hanh's poem [Call Me By My True Names](https://www.parallax.org/mindfulnessbell/article/poem-please-call-me-by-my-true-names/) to get a deep sense of this intimacy. While the idea of "detachment" does appear in Buddhism, it never refers to oneself being separate from the world; it is merely about not fixating.

### Different meanings of "unreality"

Both Advaita and Buddhism say that the world is not "real," but in different senses. In Advaita, there is something _more real_ (and thus presumably more important) than the world, whereas in Buddhism, the world is as real or unreal as anything else.

### Continuity vs spontaneity

The Godhead is a fixed, singular reference point that every moment of experience refers back to. This provides a felt sense of continuity and stability. In no-self realization, on the other hand, each moment stands entirely by itself, ever-fresh. There is nothing to link moments together, and so in each moment there is a completely fresh awe and miraculousness—a sort of "rabbit out of a hat" magic trick that never started and yet never lets up. This is the realm of pure paradox.

Long before one accomplishes these realizations, these distinctions can inspire two quite different styles of meditative practice.

---

Now let us see how imprecise language contributes to the conflation of these different realizations.

### Emptiness

In stage two, it is as though consciousness is both container and contents. Containers can be _empty_, and so this condition is very often confused with the Buddhist concept of _emptiness_ (_sunyata_).

Harris:
> If I were a Hindu, I might think in terms of Brahman, the eternal Self, of which the world and all individual minds are thought to be a mere modification. If I were a Buddhist, I might talk about the “dharmakaya of **emptiness” in which all apparent things manifest**.

Nonduality teacher Judith Blackstone:
> Fundamental consciousness is experienced as luminous stillness, or **emptiness**. ... **Within this luminous, all-pervasive stillness** moves the constantly changing dance of our thoughts, emotions, sensations and perceptions.

Kastrup:
> [I]n order to directly experience the nature of reality for himself; he might then find out that that **'emptiness' is mind at rest, a subject without objects**, pregnant with the potential for every conceivable internal relationship.

Wilber:
> ... realizing your True Nature—which you can call God, Allah, Jahweh, Brahman, Tao, Ein Sof—it doesn’t really matter, because the core of the Big Mind Process is **Emptiness** itself, which, **having no specific content** at all, can and does embrace anything that arises, integrating it all.

Notice the recurring theme: we are the stillness; the empty aware space; the ultimate Self; a subject that transcends all objects. But this is actually **not** what *sunyata* (emptiness) means in Buddhism.

The Dalai Lama:

> It is important to clarify that we are not speaking of emptiness as some kind of absolute stratum of reality, akin to, say, the ancient Indian concept of Brahman, which is conceived to be an underlying absolute reality from which the illusory world of multiplicity emerges. Emptiness is not a core reality, lying somehow at the heart of the universe, from which the diversity of phenomena arise.

Then what is it? Buddhist practitioner-scholar Karl Brunnholzl:

> Emptiness means that things do not exist as they seem, but are like illusions and like dreams.

Burbea:

> So in technical language, we can say emptiness is the realization that nothing whatsoever–_nothing_–has any what we call ‘inherent existence,’ any independent existence.

In Buddhism, absolutely everything—including *consciousness*—is "empty." Not in the sense of being *devoid of content*, but in the (admittedly idiosyncratic) sense of *not having inherent existence*. In particular, "consciousness" is not the fundamentally existent background space or principle it so clearly seems to be in stage two.

### No-self

The other common mistake is to believe that "no self" means only "no _individual_ self."

Kastrup (emphasis his):
> People think that in Buddhism there is no self, but actually what is really meant is that there is no *individual*, stand-alone self.

Wilber:
> When we realize that there is always no self (and this is happening right now) we realize that our true identity is always the Supreme Identity.

[Judith Blackstone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tyb5_kqNXB8):
> So instead of "I am Judith" and "I am a teacher" [...] we have this experience, this nonverbal experience, which we can say is no-self because it's not that [...] autobiographical self. But there is this **underlying experience** and **we could call it Self**, we can call it no-self, I don't think it matters.

But it is this very sense of an "underlying experience" that is the core illusion. The idea of a Universal Self was already well-known at the time of the Buddha. Why did he take such great pains to differentiate his teaching if it's really the same?

As he put it:

> In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. [...] When there is no you there, **you are neither here nor yonder** nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.

## A brief note on Theravada

Theravada (the other main branch of Buddhism) tends to emphasize the doctrine of no-self right from the start. While Advaitins may quibble with stage three because it seems to deny God, Theravadins tend to eschew stage one—and sometimes Mahayana as a whole—for precisely the opposite reason: it seems to _support_ it, thus contradicting the Buddha. (Indeed, many modern nominally-Buddhist teachings seem _not_ to go beyond Universal Consciousness, rendering those criticisms valid—but we will not say much more about this contentious issue here.) Yet without realizing the "light of God"—which constitutes your entire experiential field right now, by the way—progress can be very dry and sterile.

Soh:

> I noticed that many Buddhists trained under the doctrine of anatta and emptiness seem to be put off by the description of “I AM realization” as it seems to contradict anatta. This will prevent their progress as they will fail to appreciate and realize the depth of luminous presence, and their understanding of anatta and emptiness remains intellectual. It should be understood that the I AM realization does not contradict anatta realization but complements it. It is the “original face before your parents were born” of Zen, and the unfabricated clarity in Dzogchen that serves as initial rigpa, it is also the initial certainty of Mind discovered in the first of the four yogas of Mahamudra. ... [it] is a direct taste and realization of the Mind of Clear Light. The view gets refined and the taste gets brought to effortless maturity and non-contrivance in all manifestation as one’s insights deepen. ... [T]here is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature.

All that said, one could certainly be forgiven for referring to this astonishing, miraculous, luminous (yet _empty_) nature as "God." And indeed, bowing in deep reverence and devotion to it—prayer, in other words—could certainly accelerate one's progress in realizing it.

---

In closing, I would like to share my favorite riddle / poem, from a Tibetan Buddhist lineage:

> *So close you can't see it <br/>
> So deep you can't fathom it <br/>
> So simple you can't believe it <br/>
> So good you can't accept it* <br/>

🙏🏽
