# Theravada and nonduality

Many people find themselves drawn to the teachings of Theravada Buddhism, either because they were codified closer to the time of the Buddha than the Mahayana scriptures (and are thus perceived to be more authentic), or because they sound more secular. One question that arises is: do they give rise to _nondual realization_? The short answer is: not necessarily.

---

The foundational practice of Theravada is called *vipassana,* and it seems very scientific: simply perceive all phenomena and note their qualities. In particular, note how all aspects of experience are subject to [*the three marks (or characteristics) of existence*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence):

1. Anatta (not-self)
1. Anicca (impermanence)
1. Dukkha (unsatisfactoriness)

That is, every sensation is not me (and not mine), temporary, and inherently unsatisfying. That sounds reasonable enough. But _sounding reasonable_ actually has a significant drawback: you may simply be deepening an existing habit rather than uprooting it.

The ultimate goal of meditation is to discover the true nature of your experience. What's very hard to see is that your experience of reality is actually structured by the assumptions you hold about it. For example, the seemingly-natural _assumption_ that there is a self in here perceiving a world out there actually gives rise to the compelling _illusion_ of this being so.

This should make you wonder: what _else_ am I experiencing that is only the result of my assumptions? For example, the truth of _impermanence_ exposes our habitual assumption that phenomena are stable or permanent, but it takes for granted that we experience a flow of time in the first place. Depending on your proclivities, you may be willing to undermine the sense of stability, but the idea of undermining your experience of _time itself_ may seem too radical.

Luckily, the insight of impermanence is powerful enough that it can lead to a dramatic shift in perception by itself. S.N. Goenka (famous for his 7-day Vipassana retreats) [teaches us](https://tricycle.org/magazine/finding-sense-sensation/):

> Whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, gross or subtle, every sensation shares the same characteristic: it arises and passes away, arises and passes away. It is this arising and passing that we have to experience through practice ... As we reach deeper states of awareness, we will be able to detect subtler and subtler sensations, or vibrations of greater rapidity, arising and passing with greater speed. In these deep states, our mind will become so calm, so tranquil, so pure, that we will immediately recognize any impurity accompanying the agitated state and make the choice to refrain from reacting adversely.

On the other hand, the Dharmasamgiti Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism states:

> Those attached to the world take arising and ceasing to be real. Therefore the [Buddha], the Greatly Compassionate One, in order to lead them around… their fear… has taught, in accordance with conventional manners of speaking, that [phenomena] ‘arise and cease’. [In reality] though, for any phenomenon there is neither arising nor ceasing.

It is up to each practitioner to decide whether this startling claim has any merit.

---

As mentioned in the nonduality piece, numerous Mahayana schools are actually expressing the realization we call Stage 2, which implicitly (or explicitly) reifies a universal and eternal Self or Awareness. The result is that people drawn to mysticism tend to prefer Mahayana, while those averse to it are more attracted to Theravada. What is not obvious to either camp is that full realization in Mahayana actually goes _beyond_ those concepts, to arrive at a no-self/Self view.

But if full nondual realization goes beyond Self, why bother to go through Stage 1, where the Self is thoroughly reified --- as the _only_ truly existing thing, at that?

Consider the following phrases from the Buddha in the Pali Canon (the canonical scriptures of Theravada):

> Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements.

> Consciousness that is invisible, Infinite, and luminous of its own ...

This luminous aspect of experience is present at all times. In fact, we could say that it is the very principle by which anything can be _experienced at all_ --- and yet, curiously, we continually overlook it.

Given our dualistic habit of conceiving of a consciousness "in here" and a world "out there," the mind (wrongly) infers that for experience to be luminous, there must be a _source_ of that luminosity, located "in here"

---

One drawback of committing yourself earnestly to practices that sound eminently reasonable is that you might just be reinforcing your own assumptions without ever realizing it. For example, perceiving _impermanence_ requires that you hold onto your underlying framework of time, thereby continually reifying it.

S.N. Goenka (famous for his 7-day Vipassana retreats) [teaches us](https://tricycle.org/magazine/finding-sense-sensation/):

> Whether pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral, gross or subtle, every sensation shares the same characteristic: it arises and passes away, arises and passes away. It is this arising and passing that we have to experience through practice ... As we reach deeper states of awareness, we will be able to detect subtler and subtler sensations, or vibrations of greater rapidity, arising and passing with greater speed. In these deep states, our mind will become so calm, so tranquil, so pure, that we will immediately recognize any impurity accompanying the agitated state and make the choice to refrain from reacting adversely.

Contrast this to the Dharmasamgiti Sutra of Mahayana Buddhism:

> Those attached to the world take arising and ceasing to be real. Therefore the [Buddha], the Greatly Compassionate One, in order to lead them around… their fear… has taught, in accordance with conventional manners of speaking, that [phenomena] ‘arise and cease’. [In reality] though, for any phenomenon there is neither arising nor ceasing.

Such passages can begin to sound sectarian, which is not my intention here. Instead of trying to determine which is True, it might be better to ask: what are my goals? If one is not naturally inclined to question one's deepest metaphysical assumptions, there are still 


We have spent our whole lives convinced of the fundamental reality of time. From within that framework, it is indeed possible to purify our minds in a way that largely eliminates suffering. On the other hand, there may be even greater releases to be discovered by profoundly undermining our most deeply-held notions of what is real.

> [In a relative sense] everything is impermanent, but [in the absolute sense] nothing is permanent or impermanent.

There are three major living traditions of Theravada Buddhism. Two come from Burma (the U Ba Khin / S.N. Goenka tradition and that of Mahasi Sayadaw), and one from Thailand (together called the Thai Forest tradition, which has more than one sub-lineage). The insight practices from those schools are all called "vipassana." These practices usually come after some familiarity with breathing meditation to stabilize the mind (though the breath can thereafter *also* be used as an object for *vipassana*).

### U Ba Khin / Goenka

Vipassana instructions from the U Ba Khin / S.N. Goenka tradition (famous for the 7-day retreats) [go like this](https://www.dhamma.org/en/osguide):

> Move your attention systematically from head to feet and from feet to head, observing in order each and every part of the body by feeling all the sensations that you come across. Observe objectively; that is, remain equanimous with all the sensations that you experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, by appreciating their impermanent nature.

Notice how the focus is on *sensations* — that is, particular contents of perception. By contrast, many Mahayana practices encourage focus on the sense of subjectivity itself.

### Burmese (Mahasi)

[Vipassana instructions from the Mahasi Sayadaw lineage](https://buddhismnow.com/2013/09/12/vipassana-as-taught-by-the-mahasi-sayadaw-of-burma/) are similar, but have a slightly different focus, called *noting*:

> The first [stage] is a simple noting or naming of the object. This simple labelling, naming, noting—whereby attention is pointed at the object—is known as vitakka and is likened to a bee flying towards a flower. ... We just keep pointing the attention at the feeling of movement, the sensations. This attention, as it grows in strength, will eventually take all the energy out of thinking to the point where there is just the noting word.

### Thai forest

There are a variety of Thai forest sub-lineages, but let us focus on instructions from patriarch [Ajahn Chah](
(https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/the_teachings_of_ajahn_chah_web.pdf)):

> This is what we call separating the mind from the feeling. If we are clever we don’t attach, we leave things be. We become the ‘one who knows’. The mind and feeling are just like oil and water; they are in the same bottle but they don’t mix. Even if we are sick or in pain, we still know the feeling as feeling, the mind as mind. We know the painful or comfortable states but we don’t identify with them. We stay only with peace: the peace beyond both comfort and pain.

Notice that these instructions differ from the previous two in that they are not focused _outwardly_, but on the mind itself — "the one who knows." In this way, they are more similar to Mahayana practices.

---

Now let's look at how the traditions describe the end goal.

### Burmese (Mahasi)

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html

> the meditator's consciousness leaps forth into Nibbana, which is the cessation of all formations, taking it as its object.

What is such "cessation" like? Meditation teacher [Kenneth Folk](https://kennethfolkdharma.com/) (who spent twenty years training in the Mahasi tradition, including three years of intensive silent retreat in monasteries) has [this to say](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/5664311#_19_message_5666324):

> [T]he Mahasi tradition teaches us to systematically develop the ability to access nibbana, aka cessation or fruition. Many people, including myself, have trained in this way, and their reports are remarkably consistent; there is no experience in nibbana. You simply lose consciousness. ... What I am saying is that from the point of view of the person to whom it happens, nibbana and oblivion are indistinguishable, an observation that to me is so blindingly obvious that I'm surprised anyone is willing to dispute it.

### Goenka

Descriptions of enlightenment in this tradition are hard to come by. [This quote by Goenka](http://www.buddhanet.net/bvk_study/bvk21e.htm) is the closest I could find: 

> Enlightenment is ... observing oneself and eliminating conditioning.


### Thai Forest

As described in the nonduality piece, patriarch Ajahn Chah had this to say:

> We say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but in fact they are by nature already separate. Our realization is simply to know this natural separateness according to reality. When we say they are not separated it’s because we’re clinging to them through ignorance of the truth.
 
There, we explained that this is most similar to what we called Stage 1 realization. There is also good reason to believe that modern Thai forest teachers have gone beyond this realization. Ajahn Brahm:

> Just to close off the loophole that you might think you can escape non-existence of a self or soul by identifying with a transcendental state of being beyond what is seen, heard, sensed or cognized, the Buddha thunders, "and you will be neither here (with the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor beyond (outside of the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor in between the two (neither of the world nor beyond the world)."

## A synthesis?

While the Thai tradition seems to ultimately agree with Mahayana (and there has even been [a book written by a Thai monk](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Great-Mountain-Amaro-Bhikkhu/dp/0962064068) on this), what about Burmese practitioners? Soh has this to say:

> I noticed that many Buddhists trained under the doctrine of anatta and emptiness seem to be put off by the description of “I AM realization” [stage one] as it seems to contradict anatta. This will prevent their progress as they will fail to appreciate and realize the depth of luminous presence, and their understanding of anatta and emptiness remains intellectual. It should be understood that the I AM realization does not contradict Anatta realization but complements it. It is the “original face before your parents were born” of Zen, and the unfabricated clarity in Dzogchen that serves as initial rigpa, it is also the initial certainty of Mind discovered in the first of the four yogas of Mahamudra. ... [it] is a direct taste and realization of the Mind of Clear Light. The view gets refined and the taste gets brought to effortless maturity and non-contrivance in all manifestation as one’s insights deepen. ... [T]here is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature.

Therefore, for some people, doing vipassana alone may not be enough. A good example is Buddhist teacher Daniel Ingram, who spent decades practicing vipassana. By his account, he was stamped as *done* by a lineage-holder in the Mahasi tradition in Burma some time around 2003, and became authorized to teach it.

In 2009, he felt confident that the Tibetan Buddhist realization of the mind's true nature (*rigpa*) did not go beyond his own realization (arahatship, the goal of Theravada):

> *Kenneth [Folk], who says Rigpa and arahatship are two different phenomena, seems to think that with arahatship, one has the best platform to stabilize Rigpa, whereas I claim that arahatship is Rigpa, stabilized and done without other options.*

Then, in 2011, [he encountered a non-Buddhist practice called Actual Freedom](https://www.integrateddaniel.info/my-experiments-in-actualism/) that would deepen his realization. He describes the result here (emphasis mine):

> [I]t did do something totally remarkable, and that was create the ability to sit totally at rest, totally at peace, just like that, and I don't mean in some stage or state, not in some jhana, just by the field being nice to itself. That simple thing was well worth the work it took to get it. **It doesn't sound as fancy or as flashy as all the other stuff I have done, but it is more valuable than them all.**

This kind of *total simplicity* lines up well with certain aspects of how the Tibetan Dzogchen ("Great Perfection") tradition might describe *rigpa*. He goes on to say:

> I was just talking to a heavy Vajrayana [Tibetan Buddhist] practitioner about all of this at Buddhist Geeks, and she made the comment that I had attained to Vajrayana results with Theravadan methods.

AtR interprets what happened like so:

> As for whether I AM phase can be bypassed, the answer is yes, but one will tend to overlook certain aspects. For example Daniel Ingram’s [book] Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha does not go through I AM (…) before the fourth path, however, as [John Tan] wrote in 2009, “… I think what lacks in the approach of MCTB is an effective way to allow practitioners to have adequate experience of the vividness, realness and presence of Awareness and the full experience of these qualities in the transience.” … This is also the reason why Daniel needed to go through Actual Freedom practice to bring out the luminosity aspect further even though he had certain insights into anatta in MCTB 4th path.

In other words, even if one does not progress through the stages of nonduality as described as above, one must ultimately find a way to integrate the same insights — in particular, the radical aliveness — to avoid falling into nihilism.

Could vipassana practice be enough? Ingram is asked this question [here](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/11355316) in 2019:

> J.C.: If all there is is the present moment just as it is [...] including pain and difficult emotions, [...] why the need to experiment with all sorts of practices? Why the need for the switch to Zen, Vajrayana, prayer, Catholic devotional practices, martial arts, magickal practices, and so on?
>
> Why not just continue to observe exactly what's going on in the present moment and see the Three Characteristics?
>
> Why isn't that enough?

He answers:

> Well, it could be enough, sort of. The Three Characteristics are profound, very profound, staggeringly profound, and not easily grasped in their entirety. It seems perfectly reasonable to grasp them in their entirety by observing them, but there is a problem, actually, that last line contains a bunch of problems that are not obvious until you see them clearly.
>
> I will go by the words in that last line to illustrate the problem.
>
> "Continue": there is no continuing. There is nothing to continue, no past that could be continued, no future to continue into, and this moment is entirely ungraspable. No sensation could ever actually grasp or continue. Everything is fresh but perfectly ephemeral. The notion of continuing, from a high insight point of view, is a serious problem. Instead, there has to be a deep non-grasping, a perfect and flawless appreciation of non-continuing, a deep never could be a continuing, a deep nothing could ever be continuing, a deep sense of not only discontinuity, but of the utter flowing, vanishing, empty transience of anything that seemed to be able to continue. One must figure out how to go beyond continuing, beyond grasping, beyond that strange mental illusion that such a thing could ever occur or have occurred.
>
> "Observe": there is no observing. There can be no observing. There is nothing that can observe at all. Everything is just occurring where it is, naturally, straightforwardly. There is no observer. There can't be any observer. There never was any observer. Deeply understanding this is required. There never was any observation. Observation can't finally do it. One must figure out how to shift out of observing to just phenomena occurring.
>
> The qualifier "in the present moment" is a problem in some way. This almost always involves some subtle or gross pattern of sensations that we refer to mentally when we say "now", or "the present", which are not actually stable, not actually a present, not actually anything but more empty transience, yet we make them seem like a stable present. This is very subtle, deep, profound. Even "the present" doesn't withstand scrutiny, and we must be careful with this sticky concept, as it can itself become a sort of a solidified thing, part of the illusion of continuity, observation, practitioner, etc.
>
> So, while it is true that deeply comprehending emptiness, non-continuity, non-observation, and even non-present, can occur by just continuously observing this present moment, we must be careful, and sometimes it takes people shifting out of their trench of "good practice" to do something that is out from good practice and instead is just the unfolding empty wisdom dharma. Various people find various methods to make this subtle shift, and one size definitely does not fit all, so best wishes sorting out what will help you work out your salvation with diligence.
