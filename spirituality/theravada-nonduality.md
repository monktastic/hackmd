# Theravada and nonduality

Buddhism can be roughly split into the Theravada and Mahayana. The Theravada schools tend to be more orthodox and conservative, while the Mahayana schools have embraced the principle of nonduality that was only introduced later.

Because much of the literature on nonduality expresses Stage 2 insight (which posits a Self), Theravadins have good reason to be wary of it. On the other hand, Stage 3 does away with all traces of self/Self, making it consistent with the Buddha's insight of _anatta_. Moreover, there are aspects of Stage 3 insight that are easy to overlook unless one has had significant experience with the self-inquiry practices that lead to Stage 1.

In particular, it is easy to overlook the radiant, spontaneously-creative, radically alive nature of experience --- aspects that are first awakened in Stage 1, but mistaken for a Self or God. As a result, some practitioners may miss out on discovering the primordial joy that is ultimately seen to be what initiated the spiritual path (and drives its apparent progress) in the first place.

Some modern practitioners have found ways to integrate the two. Before we take a look at an example, let's take a high-level look at the extant Theravada lineages.

---

There are three major living traditions of Theravada Buddhism. Two come from Burma (the U Ba Khin / S.N. Goenka tradition and that of Mahasi Sayadaw), and one from Thailand (called the Thai Forest tradition, which has more than one sub-lineage). The insight practices from those schools are all called "vipassana." These practices usually come after some familiarity with breathing meditation to stabilize the mind (though the breath can thereafter *also* be used as an object for *vipassana*).

### U Ba Khin / Goenka

Vipassana instructions from the U Ba Khin / S.N. Goenka tradition (of which the famous 7-day Vipassana retreats are a part) [go like this](https://www.dhamma.org/en/osguide):

> Move your attention systematically from head to feet and from feet to head, observing in order each and every part of the body by feeling all the sensations that you come across. Observe objectively; that is, remain equanimous with all the sensations that you experience, whether pleasant, unpleasant or neutral, by appreciating their impermanent nature.

Notice how the focus is on *sensations* --- that is, particular *contents* of perception. This is in contrast to Mahayana practices 

### Burmese (Mahasi)

[Vipassana instructions from the Mahasi Sayadaw lineage](https://buddhismnow.com/2013/09/12/vipassana-as-taught-by-the-mahasi-sayadaw-of-burma/) have a slightly different focus, called *noting*:

> The first [stage] is a simple noting or naming of the object. This simple labelling, naming, noting—whereby attention is pointed at the object—is known as vitakka and is likened to a bee flying towards a flower. ... We just keep pointing the attention at the feeling of movement, the sensations. This attention, as it grows in strength, will eventually take all the energy out of thinking to the point where there is just the noting word.

Note again the focus on "the object."

### Thai forest

There are a variety of Thai forest sub-lineages, but we will focus on instructions from patriarch [Ajahn Chah](
(https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/thai/chah/the_teachings_of_ajahn_chah_web.pdf)):

> This is what we call separating the mind from the feeling. If we are clever we don’t attach, we leave things be. We become the ‘one who knows’. The mind and feeling are just like oil and water; they are in the same bottle but they don’t mix. Even if we are sick or in pain, we still know the feeling as feeling, the mind as mind. We know the painful or comfortable states but we don’t identify with them. We stay only with peace: the peace beyond both comfort and pain.

Notice that these instructions differ from the previous two in that they are not focused purely _outwardly_, but on the mind itself --- "the one who knows." In this way, they are not (traditional) vipassana, but are more similar to Mahayana practices.

Now let's look at how the traditions describe the end goal.

### Burmese (Mahasi)

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html

> the meditator's consciousness leaps forth into Nibbana, which is the cessation of all formations, taking it as its object.

What is such "cessation" like? Meditation teacher [Kenneth Folk](https://kennethfolkdharma.com/) (who spent twenty years training in the Mahasi tradition, including three years of intensive silent retreat in monasteries) has [this to say](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/5664311#_19_message_5666324):

> [T]he Mahasi tradition teaches us to systematically develop the ability to access nibbana, aka cessation or fruition. Many people, including myself, have trained in this way, and their reports are remarkably consistent; there is no experience in nibbana. You simply lose consciousness. ... What I am saying is that from the point of view of the person to whom it happens, nibbana and oblivion are indistinguishable, an observation that to me is so blindingly obvious that I'm surprised anyone is willing to dispute it.

### Goenka

Descriptions of enlightenment in this tradition are hard to come by. [This quote by Goenka](http://www.buddhanet.net/bvk_study/bvk21e.htm) is the closest I could find: 

> Enlightenment is ... observing oneself and eliminating conditioning.


### Thai Forest

As described in the nonduality piece, patriarch Ajahn Chah had this to say:

> We say that we separate mind and feeling in this way but in fact they are by nature already separate. Our realization is simply to know this natural separateness according to reality. When we say they are not separated it’s because we’re clinging to them through ignorance of the truth.
 
There, we explained that this is most similar to what we called Stage 1 realization. There is also good reason to believe that modern Thai forest teachers have gone beyond this realization. Ajahn Brahm:

> Just to close off the loophole that you might think you can escape non-existence of a self or soul by identifying with a transcendental state of being beyond what is seen, heard, sensed or cognized, the Buddha thunders, "and you will be neither here (with the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor beyond (outside of the seen, heard, sensed or cognized) nor in between the two (neither of the world nor beyond the world)."

## A synthesis?

While the Thai tradition seems to ultimately agree with Mahayana (and there has even been [a book written by a Thai monk](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Great-Mountain-Amaro-Bhikkhu/dp/0962064068) on this), what about Burmese practitioners? Soh has this to say:

> I noticed that many Buddhists trained under the doctrine of anatta and emptiness seem to be put off by the description of “I AM realization” [stage one] as it seems to contradict anatta. This will prevent their progress as they will fail to appreciate and realize the depth of luminous presence, and their understanding of anatta and emptiness remains intellectual. It should be understood that the I AM realization does not contradict Anatta realization but complements it. It is the “original face before your parents were born” of Zen, and the unfabricated clarity in Dzogchen that serves as initial rigpa, it is also the initial certainty of Mind discovered in the first of the four yogas of Mahamudra. ... [it] is a direct taste and realization of the Mind of Clear Light. The view gets refined and the taste gets brought to effortless maturity and non-contrivance in all manifestation as one’s insights deepen. ... [T]here is no forgoing of this ‘Witness’, it is rather a deepening of insight to include the non-dual, groundlessness and interconnectedness of our luminous nature.

Therefore, for some people, doing vipassana alone may not be enough. A good example is Buddhist teacher Daniel Ingram, who spent decades practicing vipassana. By his account, he was stamped as *done* by a lineage-holder in the Mahasi tradition in Burma some time around 2003, and became authorized to teach it.

In 2009, he felt confident that the Tibetan Buddhist realization of the mind's true nature (*rigpa*) did not go beyond his own realization (arahatship, the goal of Theravada):

> *Kenneth [Folk], who says Rigpa and arahatship are two different phenomena, seems to think that with arahatship, one has the best platform to stabilize Rigpa, whereas I claim that arahatship is Rigpa, stabilized and done without other options.*

Then, in 2011, [he encountered a non-Buddhist practice called Actual Freedom](https://www.integrateddaniel.info/my-experiments-in-actualism/) that would deepen his realization. He describes the result here (emphasis mine):

> [I]t did do something totally remarkable, and that was create the ability to sit totally at rest, totally at peace, just like that, and I don't mean in some stage or state, not in some jhana, just by the field being nice to itself. That simple thing was well worth the work it took to get it. **It doesn't sound as fancy or as flashy as all the other stuff I have done, but it is more valuable than them all.**

This kind of *total simplicity* lines up well with certain aspects of how the Tibetan Dzogchen ("Great Perfection") tradition might describe *rigpa*. He goes on to say:

> I was just talking to a heavy Vajrayana [Tibetan Buddhist] practitioner about all of this at Buddhist Geeks, and she made the comment that I had attained to Vajrayana results with Theravadan methods.

AtR interprets what happened like so:

> As for whether I AM phase can be bypassed, the answer is yes, but one will tend to overlook certain aspects. For example Daniel Ingram’s [book] Mastering the Core Teachings of the Buddha does not go through I AM (…) before the fourth path, however, as [John Tan] wrote in 2009, “… I think what lacks in the approach of MCTB is an effective way to allow practitioners to have adequate experience of the vividness, realness and presence of Awareness and the full experience of these qualities in the transience.” … This is also the reason why Daniel needed to go through Actual Freedom practice to bring out the luminosity aspect further even though he had certain insights into anatta in MCTB 4th path.

In other words, even if one does not progress through the stages of nonduality as described as above, one must ultimately find a way to integrate the same insights --- in particular, the radical aliveness --- to avoid falling into nihilism.

Could vipassana practice be enough? Ingram is asked this question [here](https://www.dharmaoverground.org/discussion/-/message_boards/message/11355316) in 2019:

> J.C.: Why the need to experiment with all sorts of practices? Why the need for the switch to Zen, Vajrayana, prayer, Catholic devotional practices, martial arts, magickal practices, and so on?
>
> Why not just continue to observe exactly what's going on in the present moment and see the Three Characteristics?
>
> Why isn't that enough?

He answers:

> Well, it could be enough, sort of. The Three Characteristics are profound, very profound, staggeringly profound, and not easily grasped in their entirety. It seems perfectly reasonable to grasp them in their entirety by observing them, but there is a problem, actually, that last line contains a bunch of problems that are not obvious until you see them clearly.
>
> I will go by the words in that last line to illustrate the problem.
>
> "Continue": there is no continuing. There is nothing to continue, no past that could be continued, no future to continue into, and this moment is entirely ungraspable. No sensation could ever actually grasp or continue. Everything is fresh but perfectly ephemeral. The notion of continuing, from a high insight point of view, is a serious problem. Instead, there has to be a deep non-grasping, a perfect and flawless appreciation of non-continuing, a deep never could be a continuing, a deep nothing could ever be continuing, a deep sense of not only discontinuity, but of the utter flowing, vanishing, empty transience of anything that seemed to be able to continue. One must figure out how to go beyond continuing, beyond grasping, beyond that strange mental illusion that such a thing could ever occur or have occurred.
>
> "Observe": there is no observing. There can be no observing. There is nothing that can observe at all. Everything is just occurring where it is, naturally, straightforwardly. There is no observer. There can't be any observer. There never was any observer. Deeply understanding this is required. There never was any observation. Observation can't finally do it. One must figure out how to shift out of observing to just phenomena occurring.
>
> The qualifier "in the present moment" is a problem in some way. This almost always involves some subtle or gross pattern of sensations that we refer to mentally when we say "now", or "the present", which are not actually stable, not actually a present, not actually anything but more empty transience, yet we make them seem like a stable present. This is very subtle, deep, profound. Even "the present" doesn't withstand scrutiny, and we must be careful with this sticky concept, as it can itself become a sort of a solidified thing, part of the illusion of continuity, observation, practitioner, etc.
>
> So, while it is true that deeply comprehending emptiness, non-continuity, non-observation, and even non-present, can occur by just continuously observing this present moment, we must be careful, and sometimes it takes people shifting out of their trench of "good practice" to do something that is out from good practice and instead is just the unfolding empty wisdom dharma. Various people find various methods to make this subtle shift, and one size definitely does not fit all, so best wishes sorting out what will help you work out your salvation with diligence.
