If you've been on the spiritual scene for any length of time, you're probably familiar with the term _nonduality_. It has various definitions, but the most common one has to do with collapsing the subject-object duality: the illusory sense that I am "in here," the world is "out there," and we are fundamentally separate. This illusion is said to underlie all forms of suffering and discontent.

What may be less clear is that there are distinct _degrees_ or _stages_ of nonduality. The differences in the stages may sound subtle (especially at first), but I believe they are crucially important to understand from the outset. This is because each stage feels so compellingly "final" that as one progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to even _believe_ that there could possibly be any work left. One often hears statements to the effect of "_I am the space of pure awareness; ideas of gain and loss can no longer touch me._" This can stall progress for decades (or perhaps lifetimes).

Not only is there a risk of getting stuck in this way, but there is the all-too-common phenomenon of assuming the role of teacher and spreading one's misunderstanding to many others. Therefore it is my wish that such knowledge become more widely available.

To be clear, this is not my original idea. I am deeply indebted to the work of practitioner Soh Wei Yu and the loose community of practitioners that have come together around it — many of whom have also expressed profound gratitude to have discovered work that synthesizes (and categorizes) many related teachings.

Although the idea of nonduality appears in many spiritual teachings, this piece takes a specifically Buddhist perspective.

In brief, there are three levels:

1. "I AM." I am the eternal, indestructible space of pure awareness.
2. "One mind." I am not only the space, but also its contents.
3. "No-self." All distinction between space and contents; subject and object; collapses.

There are levels of realization beyond stage 3, and also ways to subdivide these stages further, but we will mostly limit ourselves to these here.
